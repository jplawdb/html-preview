the best practices will not be peer reviewed or monitored, nor will it affect the assessment of the assessed
jurisdiction. Jurisdictions are free, however, to identify best practices they have adopted.
10. The minimum standard contained in the 2015 Action 14 Report has been translated into the Terms
of Reference to facilitate the review of an assessed jurisdiction’s compliance with the Action 14 minimum
standard. The Terms of Reference  do not alter the Action 14 minimum standard and in case of any
differences arising from the interpretation of any elements of the Terms of Reference  and the Action 14
minimum standard, the review of the assessed jurisdiction shall be conducted based on the minimum
standard contained in the 2015 Action 14 Report. The Terms of Reference have been designed to assess
the jurisdictions’ legal and administrative frameworks and the practical implementation of the frameworks
to determine how a jurisdiction’s dispute resolution mechanisms operate with respect to the basis of the
minimum standard of the Action 14 Report in the following areas:
 Preventing disputes (Part A);
 Availability and access to MAP (Part B);
 Resolution of MAP cases (Part C); and
 Implementation of MAP agreements (Part D).
11. They will also serve as a basis for questionnaires to be developed by the FTA MAP Forum, which
will form the basis of the reviews to be conducted by the FTA MAP Forum. Jurisdictions should provide
timely and complete responses to the questionnaires including timely and complete reporting of MAP
statistics pursuant to an agreed template and reporting framework and information on their MAP profiles
which will be published on a shared public platform based on an agreed template.
A.  Preventing disputes – Elements of the minimum standard
12. Taxpayers desire to have certainty on the tax treaty treatment of their cross -border trade and
investment and clarity on the application and interpretation of the tax trea ty. Such clarity and certainty is
equally important for tax authorities. The legal authority for competent authorities to clarify any difficulties
or doubts arising from the interpretation or application of their tax treaties is derived from tax treaty
provisions that follow paragraph 3 of Article 25. In this regard, the Action 14 minimum standard requires
that:
A.1.  Jurisdictions should ensure that their tax treaties contain a provision which requires the
competent authority of their jurisdiction to endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any
difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of their tax treaties. 6
A.2.  Jurisdictions with bilateral advance pricing arrangement (“APA”)7 programmes should provide
for the roll-back8 of APAs in appropriate cases, subject to the applicable time limits (such as
statutes of limitation for assessment) where the relevant facts and circumstances in the earlier
tax years are the same and subject to the verification of these facts and circums tances on
audit.
Best practices
B.P.1. Jurisdictions should implement bilateral APA programmes.
B.P.2. Jurisdictions should have appropriate procedures in place to publish agreements reached
by competent authorities on difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or
application of their tax treaties9 in appropriate cases.
B.P.3. Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on APAs.

B.P.4. Jurisdictions should develop the “global awareness” of the audit/examination functions
involved in international matters through the delivery of the Forum on Tax Administration’s
“Global Awareness Training Module” to appropriate personnel.
B.  Availability and access to MAP – Elements of the minimum standard
13. Where tax treaty -related disputes ari se between taxpayers and the tax authorities, a dispute
resolution mechanism should be available to taxpayers based on the tax treaty irrespective of the remedies
provided by the domestic laws of the treaty partners. Paragraph 1 of Article 25 provides a mechanism, the
MAP, for the resolution of tax treaty -related disputes. Jurisdictions should ensure that taxpayers have
access to MAP and that information relating to taxpayer access to MAP is readily available and accessible
to the public.
14. To ensure that taxpayers have access to MAP, the Action 14 minimum standard requires that:
B.1.  Jurisdictions should ensure that their tax treaties contain a MAP provision which provides that
when the taxpayer considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting Parties result
or will result for the taxpayer in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the tax treaty,
the taxpayer, may irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those
Contracting Parties, make a request for MAP assistance,  and that the taxpayer can present
the request within a period of no less than three years from the first notification of the action
resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the tax treaty. 10
B.2.  Jurisdictions should ensure that either (i) their tax treaties contain a provision which provides
that the taxpayer can make a request for MAP assistance to the competent authority of either
Contracting Party 11, or (ii) where the treaty does not permit a MAP request to be made to
either Contracting Party and the competent authority who received the MAP request from the
taxpayer does not consider the taxpayer’s objection to be justified, the competent authority
should implement a bilateral consultation or notification process which allows the ot her
competent authority to provide its views on the case (such consultation shall not be interpreted
as consultation as to how to resolve the case).
B.3.  Jurisdictions should provide access to MAP in transfer pricing cases.
B.4.  Jurisdictions should provide access to MAP in cases in which there is a disagreement between
the taxpayer and the tax authorities making the adjustment as to whether the conditions for
the application of a treaty anti-abuse provision have been met or as to whether the application
of a domestic law anti-abuse provision is in conflict with the provisions of a treaty.
B.5.  Jurisdictions should not deny access to MAP in cases where there is an audit settlement
between tax authorities and taxpayers. If jurisdictions have an administrat ive or statutory
dispute settlement/resolution process independent from the audit and examination functions
and that can only be accessed through a request by the taxpayer, jurisdictions may limit
access to the MAP with respect to the matters resolved through that process.12
B.6.  Jurisdictions should not limit access to MAP based on the argument that insufficient
information was provided if the taxpayer has provided the required information based on the
rules, guidelines and procedures made available to tax payers on access to and the use of
MAP.
B.7.  Jurisdictions should ensure that their tax treaties contain a provision under which competent
authorities may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided
for in their tax treaties.13
