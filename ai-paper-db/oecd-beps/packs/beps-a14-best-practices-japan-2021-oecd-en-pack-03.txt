Part B
Availability and access to MAP
[BP.5] Implement appropriate administrative measures to facilitate recourse to MAP
Jurisdictions should implement appropriate administrative measures to facilitate recourse to
the MAP to resolve treaty-related disputes, recognising the general principle that the choice
of remedies should remain with the taxpayer.
27. Under Article 25(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention, the mutual agreement
procedure is a dispute settlement procedure in annex to domestic available remedies and not
a substitute for such remedies. Reference is made to inter alia paragraph 7 of the Commentary
to Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which specifies that the right to submit a
MAP request is available to taxpayers without depriving them of the ordinary legal remedies
available. Facilitating recourse to the MAP through appropriate administrative measures,
under the general principle that the choice of remedies remains with taxpayers, enables them
to effectively resort to such dispute settlement procedure.
28. Where a taxpayer does not agree with an action take n by the competent department
of the National Tax Agency, it can submit within three months as from the date of that action
request for a re -examination with the Regional Commissioner of the Regional Taxation
Bureau, or the District Director of the Tax Off ice, such dependent on which of the
departments holds competence over the particular taxpayer. Alternatively and also within
three months, the taxpayer can request for a reconsideration of the action at the level of the
National Tax Tribunal. In both insta nces, a decision should be taken within three months.
Where re -examination decision is dissatisfactory to the taxpayer, the latter can ask for a
review by the National Tax Tribunal within one month after the ruling. After having run
through these administrative procedures, taxpayers are allowed to lodge an appeal at Japan’s
domestic courts within a period of six months.
29. In view of the above, Japan reported that taxpayers are for a particular dispute allowed
to request MAP assistance and at the same time seek to resolve the dispute via domestically
available judicial and administrative remedies. This is also in the situation where the specific
case under review has already been decided via these remedies, but in that situation, Japan’s
competent authority wi ll abide by that decision in its MAP discussions with the other
competent authority concerned. Furthermore, n o fees are charged to taxpayers when
submitting a MAP request, or when requesting for a pre -filing meeting before submitting a
MAP request.
30. Article 12 of Japan’s Ministerial Ordinance on the Enforcement of the Act on Special
Provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Corporation Tax Act and the Local Tax Act regarding
the application of tax treaties defines the legal basis upon which taxpayers can submit a MAP

request. This article does not contain any limitation on the scope of application of MAP, thus
also not in relation to the interaction with domestic remedies.
31. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
[BP.6] Provide access to MAP for bona fide taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments
Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide that taxpayers will be allowed access
to the MAP so that the competent authorities may resolve through consultation the double
taxation that can arise in the case of bona fide taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments.
32. A taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustment is considered bona fide where it reflects the
good faith effort of the taxpayer to report correctly, timely and properly the adjusted taxable
income from a controlled transaction or the profits attributable to a permanent establishment
with a view to reflect an arm’s length result, and where the taxpayer has otherwise timely
and properly fulfilled all of its obligations related to such taxable income or profits under the
laws of the treaty partners. As such taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments may lead to cases
of double taxation, it is relevant that there is access to MAP for resolving these cases.
Furthermore, specifying whether there is access to the MAP for these adjustments in a
jurisdiction’s MAP guidance also provides additional clarity.
33. Japan reported that generally it allows taxpayers to request MAP in case of bona fide
taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments . Whether for an indi vidual case access to MAP is
granted, however, depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.
34. Article 12 of Japan’s Ministerial Ordinance on the Enforcement of the Act on Special
Provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Corporation Tax Act and the Local Tax Act regarding
the application of tax treaties defines the legal basis upon which taxpayers can submit a MAP
request. This article does not contain any limitation on the scope of application of MAP, thus
also not in relation to cases concerni ng bona fide taxpayer -initiated foreign adjustments .
Japan’s MAP guidance, in note 2 attached to section 3(1)(a), confirms that access to MAP
may be granted in such cases, where eligible. Further, the response to question 2.10 of Japan’s
Q&A on MAP include s examples for which cases taxpayers can submit a MAP request,
which also includes such cases.14
35. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
[BP.7] Provide guidance on multilateral MAPs
Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on multilateral MAPs.
36. In recent years, globalisation has created unique challenges for existing tax treaty
dispute resolution mechanisms. Whilst the mutual agreement procedure provided for in
Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention has traditionally focused on the resolutio n
of bilateral disputes, phenomena such as the adoption of regional and global value chains as
well as the accelerated integration of national economies and markets have emphasised the
need for effective mechanisms to resolve multi -jurisdictional tax disputes. In that regard, it
