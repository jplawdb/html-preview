such an outcome is arrived at following the submission of the case to arbitration in instances
where the tax treaty contains an arbitration provision.
(vii) Agreement partially eliminating double taxation / partially resolving taxation not in accordance
with the tax treaty  (Column 9):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreemen t partially eliminating double
taxation / partially resolving taxation not in accordance with the tax treaty if the date of
notification from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an
agreement reached via competent authorit y discussion  (regardless of whether the taxpayer
accepts that outcome) (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period.
This includes cases where such an outcome is arrived at following the submission of the case
to arbitration in instances where the tax treaty contains an arbitration provision.
(viii) Agreement that there is no taxation not in accordance with the tax treaty (Column 10):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreement that there is no taxation not in
accordance with the tax treaty if the date of notification from the competent authority to the
taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an agreement reached via competent authority
discussion (regardless of whether the taxpayer accepts that outcome) (see paragraphs 13 and
14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. This includes cases where such an outcome is
arrived at following the submission of the case to arbitration in instances where the tax treaty
contains an arbitration provision.
(ix) No agreement including agreement to disagree (Column 11):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with no agreement if the date of notification
from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an outcome (see
paragraphs 13 and 14 of this not e) falls within the reporting period. “No agreement” includes
agreement to disagree.
(x) Any other outcome (Column 12):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with any other outcome (not falling within any
of the outcomes described above) if the date of notification from the competent authority to the
taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an outcome (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note)
falls within the reporting period.
For purposes of this statistics reporting framework, if there is more than one outcome relating to a MAP
request (for example, part of the MAP request is denied MAP access, part of the MAP request is granted
unilateral relief and part of the MAP request is resolved with the outcome that double taxation is fully
eliminated), the MAP c ase shall be considered closed based on the date of notification (if there is more
than one notification, the date of the last notification) from the competent authority and the outcome
communicated in that notification to the taxpayer.
(f) Number of pre-2016 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31 December [YEAR] – see
Column 13)
The number of pre-2016 cases remaining in the MAP inventory on 31 December of the year is the number
of MAP cases in a competent authority’s inventory that are pending resolut ion as of 31 December of that
year.
(g) Average time taken (in months) for closing pre-2016 cases during the reporting
period – see Column 14
(i) Jurisdictions that are currently reporting MAP Statistics pursuant to the existing reporting
framework could report in Column 14 the “average cycle time for cases completed, closed or

withdrawn during the reporting period” as per that reporting framework and should clearly
indicate this in the “Notes” section. As required under the existing reporting framework, where
a tax administration does not accept a definition or is unable to report based upon the definition,
that administration is requested to explain the difference between its reporting and the definition
of terms provided in the existing reporting framework. Such explanation should be contained
in the “Notes” section.
(ii) For all other jurisdictions, they should clearly indicate in the “Notes” section their method of
computing the average time taken to close a MAP case, including their definition of the “start”
and “end” date for purposes of computing this average.

Annex 3.D. –Definition of terms and rules for
counting MAP cases for purposes of MAP
Statistics reporting under the reporting template
in Annex 3.B.
1. Jurisdictions shall apply the following definitions and counting methods for purposes of their MAP
Statistics reporting as required under Annex 3.B. of this note:
(a) MAP case
A MAP case is a case arising from a request made by a person pursuant to the MAP provisions of a tax
treaty concerning the taxation of income and capital. Cases within a competent authority’s MAP inventory
are (i) cases arising from a request submitted directly to that competent authority by a taxpayer; and (ii)
cases arising from a request submitted by a taxpayer to the competent authority of the treaty partner and
subsequently presented by that other competent authority to the competent auth ority. These are cases
arising from requests submitted under a provision based upon Article 25(1) of the OECD Model Tax
Convention (OECD, 2019 [2]), or under Article 25(3), provided that in the latter case the requests are
taxpayer-specific and not one for a generic interpretation of the provision of a tax treaty. In addition, cases
arising under Article 4(2), sub d, or Article 4(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019[2]) to
determine residence of a taxpayer also counts as a MAP case.
A MAP also concerns case arising from a request submitted under the EU Arbitration Convention 1 and
arising from a complaint on a question in dispute submitted under Article 3(1) of the Council Directive (EU)
2017/1852 of 10 October 2017 on tax dispute resolution mechanisms in the European Union. 2
A MAP case however shall not include (i) a request for an Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) including
a request to apply the outcome of the APA to previous filed tax years not included within the original scope
of the APA (i.e. a request for the “roll -back” of the APA); or (ii) a “protective” MAP request. A “protective”
MAP request is a MAP request submitted by the taxpayer in order to ensure that its request is made within
the time frame permitted under the relevant tax treaty but the taxpayer has indicated to the competent
authority or agreed with the competent authority that the request should not be examined until further
notification is received from the taxpayer to do so. Once such notification (that a taxpayer asks that a
previously protective MAP request should now be examined) is received by the competent authority, the
MAP request shall be regarded as “received by a competent authority” in the sense of paragraphs 10 and
11 of this note.
(b) Counting of MAP cases
A MAP request submitted by the taxpayer to one or both Contracting States to a tax treaty shall be counted
as only one MAP case if
(iii) the request concerns the taxation of only one taxpayer i n either Contracting State or in each
Contracting State; or
(iv) where the issue submitted for MAP discussion relates to transaction(s) of an entity which is not
liable to tax at the level of the entity itself (for example, a transparent entity or an entity wh ich
