List 3: regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP
For the purpose of visibility for the FHTP, certain regimes will be recorded in this separate list of the
compilation, which is shared for information with the FHTP in advance of subsequent meetings.
This list will include the following types of regimes:
• Regimes identified under Step 1 that are out of the FHTP’s scope as a result of Step 2;
• Regimes within the FHTP’s scope for which no BEPS impact assessment is undertaken (as a result
of Step 3);
• Regimes that were concluded as “not harmful” following a BEPS impact assessment under Step
4;
• Regimes that are subject to ongoing monitoring following a BEPS impact assessment under Step
4;
• Regimes that were previously con cluded as “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”,
“disadvantaged areas” and “non-operational”;
• Grandfathered non-IP regimes for which the transitional period has not yet ended;
• IP regimes providing benefits to the third category of IP assets or the rebuttable presumption; and
• Any other types of regimes the FHTP has decided to include in this list.
Both Inclusive Framework members and the Secretariat may propose that a regime on this list be
reconsidered for a BEPS impact assessment in accordance with Steps 3 and 4 at any subsequent moment
in time. The brief description of the regime and details on the features and size of the jurisdiction offering
the regime as mentioned in paragraph 0 will assist the FHTP in undertaking this reconsideration, as well
as any new potential information that became available. The process in this regard is the same as for the
initial identification of regimes, as set out under Step 1 and can be undertaken at any moment.
In a similar regard, both Inclusive Framework members and the Secretariat may also propose that a regime
on this list will be removed, e.g. because no BEPS risks have substantiated over a prolonged period of
time. Such decision would be taken on a consensus basis by the FHTP.
Step 4. BEPS impact assessment
Once a regime has been identified and determined to be within the scope of the FHTP’s work, and the
FHTP has decided to pursue a BEPS impact assessment, the Secreta riat will conduct an impact
assessment of the regime in terms of its BEPS -risks, working with the concerned jurisdiction. Based on
the outcome of the impact assessment, the FHTP will decide if the regime should be legislatively reviewed
or not (under Step 5).
The BEPS impact assessment is an assessment of the expected economic effects of the regime in terms
of producing BEPS -risks for other jurisdictions. As such, the Secretariat will, inter alia, take into account
the following factors for determining the impact of the regime in terms of BEPS-risks:
• the primary objectives of the regime: e.g. if the regime is focussed on manufacturing activities, and
not on geographically mobile activities, or if the regime only targets disadvantaged areas, the BEPS
impact of the regime could be low;
• the jurisdiction offering the regime: e.g. if the jurisdiction has a low GDP or is classified as a low -
income economy by the World Bank, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;
• the number of taxpayers benefiting from the r egime (if available): e.g. if only a small number of
taxpayers is benefitting from the regime, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;
• the total income subject to preferential tax treatment (if available): e.g. if only a small amount of
income is benefitting from the regime, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;
• when the regime is a replacement regime of the previous regime, data from the previous regime
and the FHTP’s previous experience; and

• any other factor(s) or source of information deemed t o be relevant for the BEPS impact
assessment, to be decided on a case-by-case basis.
Based on the BEPS impact assessment, the Secretariat will propose one of the following three decisions
to the FHTP:
• Proceed with legislative review.
When the assessment indicates that the regime could have a significant BEPS impact, the FHTP
should undertake a legislative review of the regime, as described under Step 5. T he decision to
that effect is taken by the FHTP on a consensus minus-one basis.
• No legislative review.
When the assessment indicates that the regime is not expected to have a significant BEPS impact,
the FHTP would conclude its review by finding the regime “not harmful”. The decision to that effect
is taken by the FHTP on a consensus basis. The regime will be included in the FHTP’s public lists
of regimes as well as the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
• No legislative review, but ongoing monitoring.
When the assessment is either inconclusive or indicates that the regime could potentially, but does
not currently have a significant BEPS impact, the FHTP would keep the regime “under review” and
would annually monitor the regime for three years. The decision to that effect is taken by the FHTP
on a consensus minus-one basis. The regime will be included in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes
as well as the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
If the FHTP cannot agree on the outcomes of the BEPS impact assessment, the dec ision will be deferred
to the next FHTP meeting. In the meantime, the Secretariat will conduct further research into the regime
and will work towards obtaining consensus (minus -one) amongst delegates on the decision to be taken.
The regime will be kept “under review” and will be included in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes.
Step 5. Legislative review
Either upon request of the jurisdiction offering the regime, or as a result of the BEPS impact assessment
under Step 4, the FHTP will undertake a legislative review of the regime. This is a review of the legislation
of the regime against the FHTP’s criteria.
The FHTP conducts its reviews of preferential regimes against a number of factors, originally set out in the
1998 Report (OECD, 1998[3]), which laid the foundation for the OECD’s work on harmful tax practices,
currently consist of five key factors and five other factors.
Five key factors
The regime imposes no or low effective tax rates on income from geographically
mobile financial and other service activities.
The regime is ring-fenced from the domestic economy.
The regime lacks transparency.
There is no effective exchange of information with respect to the regime.
The regime fails to require substantial activities.2
Five other factors
An artificial definition of the tax base.
Failure to adhere to international transfer pricing principles.
Foreign source income exempt from residence country taxation.
Negotiable tax rate or tax base.
Existence of secrecy provisions.
2 This includes the 2015 BEPS Action 5 Final Report (OECD, 2015[2]), the 2017 Progress Report (OECD, 2017[8]), and
any guidance on substantial activities agreed by the FHTP and Inclusive Framework thereafter.
