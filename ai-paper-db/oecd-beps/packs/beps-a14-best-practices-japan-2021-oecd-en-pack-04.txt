is for clarity purposes relevant that jurisdiction’s MAP guidance includes information on
availability of and access to multilateral MAPs.
37.  Japan’s MAP guidance, in note 1 attached to Section 3(1)(a), states that domestic
corporations may initiate multilateral MAP discussions by filing separate requests with
regard to each of the treaties involved based on the location of the associated enterprises .
Further, the response to question 2.10 of Japan’s Q&A on MAP  specifies that MAP is
available in such cases.
38. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
[BP.8] Provide for suspension of collection procedures for pending MAP cases
Jurisdictions should take appropriate measures to provide for a suspension of colle ctions
procedures during the period a MAP case is pending. Such a suspension of collections should
be available, at a minimum, under the same conditions as apply to a person pursuing a
domestic administrative or judicial remedy.
39. If, following an adjustment taxpayers immediately have to pay the tax due, whereas
the same amount was already paid to the tax administration of the other jurisdiction involved,
double taxation will in fact occur. As taxpayers may then face significant cash -flow issues,
at least for the period the MAP case is pending, it is relevant that jurisdictions provide for
suspension of collection procedure for this period under at least the same conditions as
available for domestic remedies.
40. Japan reported that taxpayers can ask for  the suspension of tax collection for the
period a MAP case is pending and insofar it concerns a case concerning the allocation of
profits between associated enterprises. The relevant rules in relation her eto are included in
Article 66-4-2 of the Act on Sp ecial Measures Concerning Taxation, which stipulates that
where a taxpayer has submitted a MAP request to either Japan’s competent authority or the
competent authority of its treaty partner, the National Tax Agency may – upon request by the
taxpayer – grant a suspension of tax collection for the tax due for which a MAP request is
submitted.15 The period for which such suspension is granted ranges from the date on which
the taxation in question  becomes due and payable (or on the date where a request for
suspension is submitted if this is later) and ends one month after the date on which the MAP
agreement is implemented in Japan. Where no MAP agreement is entered into, the suspension
is granted until one month from the date the Commissioner’s notification to the taxpayer of
the fact that the MAP case is closed. Furthermore, under the domestic rules the suspension
of tax collection may be cancelled when the taxpayer: (i) has withdrawn its MAP request, (ii)
does not co -operate in providing documents necessary for MAP discussions, (iii) is found
unable to pay the tax due, (iv) does not issue a security deposit, (v) has any new delinquent
national tax due other  than taxes  related to the suspension of tax collection, or (iv) is found
inappropriate to be granted a suspension of tax collection.
41. Furthermore, section 43 of Japan’s MAP guidance includes detailed information on
the possibility for taxpayers to obtain a suspension of tax collection for the period a MAP is
pending, the conditions under which the request for such a suspension are granted, what steps
taxpayers need to take when filing a request hereto and the process for granting the requested
15  The relevant rules to calculate the tax due are included in Article 39 -12-2(1) and 39-112-2(1) of the Order for Enforcement
of the Act on Special Measures concerning taxation.

suspension.16 In this respect, section 43 specifies the following requirements  to be fulfilled
before a suspension of tax collection will be granted:
 The taxpayer is subject to taxation in Japan as listed in the specific provisions;
 The taxpayer has submitted a MAP request;
 The amount of tax due is the subject of the consideration with a treaty partner in
MAP;
 The taxpayer does not have any delinquent national taxes other than taxes related to
the suspension of tax collection; and
 The taxpayer deposited a security equivalent to the amount for which a suspension of
tax collection is requested.
42. Further, a summary of the above provisions, in easy-to-read language, has been added
to Japan’s Q&A on MAP in Q 4-1 to Q 4-10 under the title ‘Grace of tax payment related to
transfer pricing taxation’.

PART C: RESOLUTION OF MAP CASES  19

Part C
Resolution of MAP Cases
[BP.9] Permit taxpayers to request multi-year resolution of recurring issues through
the MAP
Jurisdictions should implement appropriate procedures to permit, in certain cases and after
an initial tax assessment, requests made by taxpayer which are within the time period
provided for in the tax treaty for the multi -year resolution through the MAP of recurring
issues with respect to filed tax years, where the relevant facts and circumstances are the same
and subject to the verification of such facts and circumstances on audit.
44. In certain cases, a MAP request with respect to a specific adjustment to income may
present recurring issues that may be relevant in previous or subsequent tax years. Allowing
taxpayers to submit requests for the multi-year resolution through MAP with respect to such
recurring issues, where the relevant facts and circumstances are the same, may help avoid
duplicative MAP requests and facilitate a more efficient use of competent authority
resources.
45. Japan reported it allows taxpayers to request the  multi-year resolution of recurring
issues through the MAP  where the facts and circumstances of the case remained the same
and insofar the case concerns the application of the arm’s length principle for profit allocation
between associated enterprises and the attri bution of profits to permanent establishments.
Japan specified that a MAP agreement concerning an initial tax assessment can be prolonged
to subsequent fiscal years via a bilateral APA. To this end, taxpayers need to submit a MAP
request for the initial tax assessment alongside an APA request (including a roll-back request)
for the current and subsequent fiscal years.
46. Japan’s MAP guidance, in note 1 attached to Section 3( 2), states that for the multi -
year resolution of cases, the taxpayer must file a MAP r equest for the present year and an
APA request for future years.
47. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
[BP.10] Publish explanation of the relationship between the MAP and domestic
remedies
Jurisdictions should publish an ex planation of the relationship between the MAP and
domestic law administrative and judicial remedies.
