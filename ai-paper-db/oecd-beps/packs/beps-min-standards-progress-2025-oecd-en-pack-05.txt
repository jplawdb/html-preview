Revised methodology for regime reviews
This section sets out in further detail the revised meth odology for identifying, assessing, and reviewing
preferential regimes.
Step 1. Identification
The first step is the identification or self-identification of the preferential regime. This is an essential step in
the FHTP’s review process, because without it, the FHTP is not aware of all the regimes that may require
review. The FHTP should consider reviewing a regime of an Inclusive Framework member, or a non -
Inclusive Framework member  if considered a jurisdiction of relevance, only if it is identified by another
Inclusive Framework member, by the jurisdiction offering the preferential regime itself, or by the
Secretariat.
When an Inclusive Framework member seeks to identify a preferen tial regime of another Inclusive
Framework member or a regime of a (potential) jurisdiction of relevance, it will notify the Secretariat. This
can be done at any moment in time and on informal and anonymous basis. It will not be communicated
with the FHTP whether the regime was identified by the Secretariat or by another Inclusive Framework
member.
The Secretariat’s research of preferential regimes is based on an evaluation of any relevant or recent
developments from public sources. However, the FHTP should not rely solely on the Secretariat’s findings
or the limitations of its research, because the collection and analysis of publicly available data may be
affected by factors such as scope, accessibility, and reliability of these resources.
Step 2. Secretariat’s initial assessment
If a regime has been identified or self-identified, the Secretariat will, working with the concerned jurisdiction,
conduct an initial assessment to determine whether the regime potentially falls within the FHTP scope (i.e.
is the regime preferential and does it provide tax benefits to business income from geographically mobile
activities, including the provision of intangibles).
In line with the FHTP’s standing practice under its previous methodology, if a regime is found to be out of
scope under Step 2, it will not be reviewed by the FHTP, nor will any monitoring be carried out. This
outcome will be communicated to the jurisdiction(s) that have identified or self -identified the regime and
the regime will be included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). If a
regime is found to be within the FHTP’s scope , it will be included in the list of regimes to be potentially
submitted to a BEPS impact assessment (list 2) under Step 3.
If a jurisdiction requests the FHTP to register a regime that is offered in that jurisdiction as an out-of-scope
regime, the regime will be reviewed promptly under Step 5 (i.e. without a BEPS impact assessment) . In
those instances, the out-of-scope conclusion, if adopted by the FHTP, would be published.
Step 3. Compilation of regimes potentially to be reviewed
As this methodology aims to focus the review primarily on cases with a significant BEPS-risk, it is important
to ensure that the FHTP maintains visibility of all prefe rential regimes that are in scope. A compilation of
regimes within the scope of the FHTP’s review will therefore be circulated before each FHTP meeting in
order for the FHTP to determine which regimes should be reviewed, in light of their potential to crea te
significant BEPS-risks. The compilation consists of three parts:
1. A list of regimes for which the jurisdiction opted for a legislative review of the regime. This
section is shared with the FHTP for information and the regimes contained in this list will
immediately proceed to the legislative review under Step 5;

2. A list of regimes that are within the scope of the FHTP, including a preliminary indication from
the Secretariat on whether and why the regime should or should not undergo a BEPS impact
assessment under Step 4. This section is shared with the FHTP for approval; and
3. A list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP including those for which no
BEPS impact assessment or legislative review is undertaken. This section is shared with the
FHTP for information.
Each list will include a brief description of the regime, along with details about the features and scale of
the jurisdiction offering the regime (e.g. the size of the economy and previous existence of preferential
regimes), as well as the level of tax preference (e.g. exemption or lower tax rate). This information allows
the FHTP to have a high -level appreciation of the regime, which assists the FHTP in its decision of
undertaking a BEPS impact assessment or to proceed with the revie w of a regime on the list of regimes
for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). The content of the three lists is further outlined
below.
List 1: regimes proceeding to legislative review at the request of the jurisdiction
This list includes r egimes that a jurisdiction explicitly requested to undergo a legislative review. The
outcome of the legislative review may determine that the regime is out of scope.
Regimes on this list will not undergo an impact assessment. Instead, they will proceed di rectly to a
legislative review under Step 5, either at the next or a subsequent FHTP meeting. As such, this list is
shared with the FHTP for information purposes only.
Note that under this revised methodology, the FHTP will no longer be able to conclude th at a regime is
“potentially harmful but not actually harmful” (see further explanation under Step 4 below). This is because
the consideration as to whether a potentially harmful regime is actually harmful is now replaced by the prior
BEPS impact assessment  at Step 4. By opting not to submit the regime to a BEPS impact assessment
under Step 4 and agreeing to proceed directly to legislative review, the jurisdiction agrees that such a
legislative review is sufficient for determining whether a regime is harmful  or not and there is no need to
undertake a separate BEPS impact assessment to determine whether the regime is actually harmful or
not.
List 2: regimes to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact assessment
The regimes on this second list are regimes th at are within the scope of the FHTP’s review (i.e. they are
preferential to business income from geographically mobile activities), and for which the FHTP must
consider whether it is necessary to undertake a BEPS impact assessment.
As mentioned in paragraph 0, each regime will include a brief description of the regime and details on the
features and size of the jurisdiction offering the regime, as well as the level of tax preference. This supports
the FHTP in determining whether a listed regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment under Step
4. To prepare the FHTP for its decision, the Secretariat will also share its preliminary proposal for the
decision by the FHTP, taking into account whether the regime is prima facie unlikely to produce a significant
BEPS impact, e.g. because the rate of the regime is relatively high or because the jurisdiction offering the
regime is a low-income economy.
Regimes included on this list will proceed to a BEPS impact assessment, unless the FHTP decides on a
consensus basis that no BEPS impact assessment will take place. In such case, the regime will be included
in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
