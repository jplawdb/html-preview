12. Recognising that the taxpayer’s MAP submission might not include all the information and
documentation required for the competent authority to examine the MAP request, and that the notification
including the confirmation of receipt of the notification (where applicable) in paragraph 10 above could be
made before the competent authority receives all such information, the “start” date shall be:
(v) One week from the date of notification by the competent authority that receives the MAP
request from the taxpayer or five weeks from the receipt of the taxpayer’s MAP request,
whichever is the earlier date;6 except
(vi) where a competent authority receives a MAP request that does not include all the information
and documentation required to be furnished pursuant to its published MAP guidance and the
competent authority requests such information and/or documentation within three months from
the receipt of the MAP submission, in which case the “start” date shall be the date under (i) or
the date when such missing information and/or documentation is received by that competent
authority, whichever is the later date.
13. There are also instances where members of the same taxpayer group submit MAP requests on
the same issue(s) to their respective competent authorities (for example, in transfer pricing cases where
the parties to a transaction each submit a MAP request to their respect ive competent authorities arising
from a primary adjustment made by one of the Contracting States). Furthermore, as described in paragraph
5 above, a taxpayer could also submit the same MAP request to both competent authorities. In these
circumstances, where there are different dates for the competent authorities under the application of the
rules in paragraph 10 above, the earlier date shall be the “start” date.
(ii) Closing of MAP case (“end” date)
14. The “end” date of a MAP case is (i) the date of an official communication (typically in the form of a
letter) from the competent authority to the taxpayer to inform him of the outcome of its MAP request; or (ii)
the date the competent authority receives a notification from the taxpayer on the withdrawal of its MAP
request. The competent authority that receives the MAP request from the taxpayer should also duly inform
the other competent authority of its notification to the taxpayer on the outcome of the MAP case or in case
of a withdrawal of the MAP request by the taxpayer, of the date of such withdrawal. For (i), the outcome of
a MAP request could be one of the following:
 access to MAP is denied (i.e. not an admissible request or denied for any other reaso ns)
 objection is not justified objection
 objection is resolved via domestic remedy
 unilateral relief will be granted
 competent authority agreement that will (or would, if accepted by taxpayer, regardless of whether
the taxpayer accepts that outcome) fully eliminate double taxation or fully resolve taxation not in
accordance with the tax treaty
 competent authority agreement that will (or would, if accepted by taxpayer, regardless of whether
the taxpayer accepts that outcome) partially eliminate double taxati on or partially resolve taxation
not in accordance with the tax treaty
 competent authority agreement that there is no taxation not in accordance with the tax treaty
 no competent authority agreement is reached including agreement to disagree
 any other outcome.
15. In instances where more than one taxpayer submits a MAP request on the same issue(s) to their
respective competent authorities as described in paragraph 12 above or where a taxpayer could also
submit the same MAP request to both competent authorities as described in paragraph 5 above, and there
are different “end” dates for the competent authorities, the “end” date shall be the earlier of these dates.

(iii) Milestone 1 (if applicable): Date of position paper
16. In the second stage of the MAP as desc ribed in paragraph 7 which is aimed at “resolving the
dispute on an agreed basis, i.e. by agreement between competent authorities”, one of the competent
authorities would present its position on the case to the other competent authority (via a “position pa per”)
before the commencement of discussions between the competent authorities. 7 The position paper should
provide the basis for and explanation of the position taken by the jurisdiction and should address the
arguments made by the taxpayer in its submissi on, to facilitate the discussion of the case with the other
competent authority. The date to be captured for purposes of Milestone 1 for both competent authorities is
the date the position paper is presented by one competent authority to the other competen t authority. In
instances where there is more than one position paper, the date of the earliest position paper shall be the
date for Milestone 1.
MAP Statistics reporting and publication
17. In accordance with one of the elements of the Action 14 minimum stan dard8, the Terms of
Reference9 require jurisdictions to provide timely and complete reporting of MAP statistics pursuant to an
agreed template and reporting framework. This framework is described below:
(i) Annex 3.A. is for the reporting and publication of MAP statistics relating to MAP requests that
are not reported under Annex 3.B. (“pre-2016 cases”);
(ii) Annex 3.B. which comprises Part (I) and Part (II) is for the reporting and publication of MAP
statistics relating to MAP cases that are received by a compete nt authority from the taxpayer
on or after 1 January 2016 (“post-2015 cases”); and
(iii) Annex 3.C. and Annex 3.D. contain definitions of terms and the rules for counting MAP cases
for the purposes of Annex 3.A. and Annex 3.B.
18. A jurisdiction should report its MAP statistics in accordance with the reporting templates in Annex
3.A. and Annex 3.B. for a calendar year by no later than 31 May of the following calendar year, for
subsequent publication on the OECD website. Jurisdictions are to submit their first reports by 31 May 2017
for the 2016 calendar year (also referred to as the 2016 reporting period). For the 2016 reporting period,
Annex 3.B. will be published on an aggregated basis instead of on a jurisdiction specific basis.
19. For new members that joined the Inclusive Framework after 2016, they are to submit their first
reports by 31 May of the year following the year of their membership. For example, if a member joins the
Inclusive Framework in 2017, it should submit its first report by 31 May 2018. In this first report, it should
report MAP statistics relating to MAP cases that are received by a competent authority from the taxpayer
on or after 1 January 2017 in Annex 3.B. (for “post-2016 cases”) and report in Annex 3.A. (“for pre-2017
cases”) statistics relating to MAP requests not reported under Annex 3.B. In this regard, for members that
joined the Inclusive Framework after 2016, all references to “pre -2016” in this note should be understood
to mean “pre-year of membership” and all references to “post-2015” means “post-year preceding the year
of membership”.
Additional data reporting from the 2023 reporting year onwards
20. The following data points need to be reported as from the 2023 reporting year onwards:
