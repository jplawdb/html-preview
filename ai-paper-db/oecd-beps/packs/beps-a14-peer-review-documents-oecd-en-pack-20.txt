Enter in this column the number of pre -2016 cases (i.e. MAP request received which are not
reported in Annex 3.B.) in your MAP inventory that are pending resolution as of 1 January of
the reporting period, reporting separately for “Attribution / Allocation” (see Row 1, Column 1)
and “Others” (see Row 2, Column 1) MAP cases. The “ Total” (see Row 3, Column 1) is the
sum of the number of cases for “Attribution / Allocation” and “Others”.
(ii) Columns 3 to 12: Number of pre-2016 cases closed during the reporting period
with an outcome as described in columns 3 to 12
Enter in each of these columns the number of pre -2016 cases closed in the reporting period
based on the outcome of each case as stated in the heading of each of these columns, reporting
separately for “Attribution / Allocation” and “Others” MAP cases. The “Total” for each of these
columns is the sum of the number of cases reported under each of these columns for
“Attribution / Allocation” and “Others”.
(iii) Column 13: Number of pre-2016 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31
December [Year]
Enter in this co lumn the number of pre -2016 cases in your MAP inventory that are pending

The number of pre -2016 cases relating to “ Attribution / Allocat ion” and “ Others” should
reflect:
 the number of pre -2016 cases in MAP inventory on 1 January of the reporting period
(Column 2) for that category of cases;
 minus the number of pre -2016 cases that are closed during the reporting period with
outcome as stated in Columns 3 to 12 for that category of cases.
The “Total” number of pre-2016 cases remaining in your MAP inventory on 31 December of the
year is the sum of the number of pre -2016 cases relating to “ Attribution / Allocation ” and
“Others” that are remaining in the MAP inventory on 31 December of the year.
(iv) Column 14: Average time taken (in months) for closing pre-2016 cases during
the reporting period
Enter in this column the average time taken (in months) from the start to the cl ose of pre-2016
cases for such cases closed during the reporting period, reporting separately for “ Attribution /

Annex 3.B. MAP Statistics reporting for the [YEAR] reporting period (1
January [YEAR] to 31 December [YEAR]) by [Name of Jurisdiction] for post-
2015 cases closed in the [YEAR] reporting period1
Annex B should be submitted to the Secretariat (email: fta.map@oecd.org) by 31 May of the calendar year following the year of the reporting period for subsequent publication on the
OECD website. For the 2016 reporting period, Annex B will be published on an aggregated basis instead of on jurisdiction specific basis.
For countries that are currently reporting MAP Statistics for publication on the OECD website (see: http://www.oecd.org/ctp/dispute/), with effect from the 2016 reporting period (1 January
2016 to 31 December 2016) they are only required to report MAP Statistics for publication based on Annex B of this note.
Jurisdictions should report their MAP Statistics for post-2015 cases based on the definition of terms and rules for counting MAP cases as contained in Annex D.

2 Please note that this data has not been matched with the concerned treaty partners. In addition, please note that delays in individual MAP cases may be owing to several reasons,
many of them being out of the concerned competent authority’s control, and thus, the age of pending MAP cases should be seen in conjunction with the attempts made by jurisdictions
to resolve such cases as evident in the average time taken to resolve cases.
