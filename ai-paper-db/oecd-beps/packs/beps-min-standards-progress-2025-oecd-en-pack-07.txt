RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025
Each key factor is briefly described below.
• The regime imposes no or low effective tax rates on income from geographically mobile financial
and other service activities.
A low or zero effective tax rate on the relevant income  is a necessary starting point for an
examination of whether a preferential tax regime is harmful. When a preferential regime benefits
income from geographically mobile activities and meets this factor, it is in scope for the FHTP.
However, the tax rate factor alone does not imply that a preferential regime is harmful; rather it is
a gateway criterion that if met means that the FHTP will continue the review process to determine
if one or more of the other key factors are implicated.
• The regime is ring-fenced from the domestic economy.
Some preferential tax regimes are partly or fully insulated from the domestic economy of the
jurisdiction providing the regime. The fact that a jurisdiction has designed the regime in a way that
protects its own economy from t he regime by ring -fencing provides a strong indication that a
regime has the potential to create harmful spill-over effects. Ring-fencing focusses on the legal or
administrative barriers to participation in the domestic economy, rather than the case where only
a small number of domestic  taxpayers take advantage of the regime . Ring-fencing may take a
number of forms, including:
o A regime may explicitly or implicitly exclude resident taxpayers from taking advantage of its
benefits.
o Enterprises which benefit from the regime may be explicitly or implicitly prohibited from
operating in the domestic market.
• The regime lacks transparency.
A lack of transparency may arise from the way in which a regime is designed and administered.
For example, where the de tails of the regime or its application are not apparent, or there is
inadequate regulatory supervision or financial disclosure.
• There is no effective exchange of information with respect to the regime.
When the jurisdiction lacks an effective exchange of information with respect to the regime, this
can inhibit the ability of other tax authorities to enforce effectively its rules.
• The regime encourages operations or arrangements that are purely tax -driven and involve no
substantial activities.
This factor has been elaborated in the work of the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015), requiring
that in order to benefit from a preferential regime, the taxpayer must have engaged in the activities
giving rise to the income.
In the case of regimes that give benefits to income from intellectual property (“IP”), this requirement
means being compliant with the “nexus approach” as detailed in the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD,
2015[2]). The nexus approach requires a link betwe en the income benefiting from the IP regime
and the extent to which the taxpayer has undertaken the underlying research and development
that generated the intellectual property. The FHTP uses a substantive approach, reviewing IP
regimes that are targeted at IP income (such as patent boxes) as well as regimes that provide for
benefits to a wider range of geographically mobile activities but include income from IP (such as
certain free zones or international business companies).
The BEPS Action 5 Report  (OECD, 2015 [2]) also contains more general guidance for the
application of the substantial activities criterion to non-IP regimes, and further detail on the FHTP’s
approach is set out in Annex D of the 2017 Progress Report  (OECD, 2017[8]). This ensures that
the core income generating activities are undertaken, including with an adequate number of full -
time, qualified employees and an adequate amount of operating expenditure, supported b y a
transparent mechanism to ensure compliance.

If the regime meets the gateway criterion of imposing no or low effective tax rates on income from
geographically mobile financial and other service activities  and is not compliant with one or more of the
other key factors, it would be found to be “harmful”. Under the previous methodology, the FHTP could also
conclude regimes as “potentially harmful” and “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”. However, this
assessment is now undertaken before the FHTP’s legislative review and is therefore no longer a potential
outcome after such review. Where a regime is found to be “harmful”, the jurisdiction is expected to amend
or abolish the regime in accordance with the FHTP timelines. This includes ensuring that such regimes are
quickly closed-off to new applicants and new expansions of business activities, and that any grandfathering
is provided for a limited transition period only. These timelines are set out below under the procedural
aspects.
Procedural aspects
Conclusions
The review by the FHTP can result in one of the following conclusions:
Result Meaning Decision taken in
Harmful  The regime has harmful features. The jurisdiction is expected to take
measures in order to remove the harmful features of the regime.
Step 5
Not harmful  The regime is in scope but does not have harmful features or a significant
BEPS impact.
Step 4 or 5
Amended (not harmful) The regime has had its harmful features removed and is therefore not
harmful.
Step 5
Out of scope The regime does not grant tax benefits to geographically mobile activities. Step 5
Amended (out of scope) The regime has been amended so that it no longer grants tax benefits to
geographically mobile activities and is therefore out of scope for  the
FHTP.
Step 5
In the process of being
amended / in the process of
being eliminated
The jurisdiction has communicated to the FHTP the commitment of its
government to abolish or amend the regime in light of the discussions by
the FHTP about the features  of the regime that are of concern . This
commitment involves a commitment to making the amendments within
the timelines indicated below.
Step 5
Abolished A definite date for complete abolition of the regime has been announced,
and the regime is transparent and has effective exchange of information.
No new entrants are permitted into the regime. Any grandfathering for
existing beneficiaries is consistent with the applicable framework and
timelines.
Step 5
Under review The FHTP is continuing to co nsider the features of the regime and
whether the criteria are implicated.
