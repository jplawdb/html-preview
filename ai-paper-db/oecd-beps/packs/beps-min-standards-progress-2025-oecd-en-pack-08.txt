Timelines
As noted in the above table, one of the conclusions that the FHTP can reach is “in the process of being
amended/eliminated”. This conclusion is reached when the FHTP decided that the regime has potentially
harmful features that need to be removed, but when the jurisdiction made a commitment to abolish or
amend the regime. In those instances, the timelines for closing-off and grandfathering are:
Timelines for closing-off and grandfathering of regimes
Event Explanation Timeline
Cut-off date for new entrants (both new
taxpayers and new assets and/or
activities of existing taxpayers) to be
eligible for grandfathering
When a jurisdiction provides
grandfathering, new entrants (both new
taxpayers and new assets and/or
activities of existing taxpayers) coming
into the regime after the cut -off date
should not benefit from grandfathering
after the close-off date.3
Publication date of the FHTP’s decision
Close-off date (the date the regime is
amended or abolished)
Closing-off the regime means that no
new entrants are allowed to use the
regime. New entrants include both new
taxpayers, but also new assets (e.g. IP
assets) and/or new activities of existing
taxpayers.
As soon as possible, and no later than
12 months after the publication date of
the FHTP’s decision (or where
necessary because of the legislative
process, by 31 December of the year
following the cut-off date)
Grandfathering period  This is the maximum transition period
granted to entrants benefiting from the
regime as at the cut -off date.
Jurisdictions are generally permitted,
but not required, to provide
grandfathering (see below).
31 December in the yea r which is three
years after the publication date of the
FHTP’s decision. For example, if a
regime is reported as “in the process of
being amended / eliminated ” in July
2025, the end of grandfathering would
be no later than 31 December 2028.
Only ring-fenced regimes and regimes lacking substantial activities requirements can be grandfathered.
Regimes lacking transparency and exchange of information cannot be grandfathered with respect to the
harmful aspect of that regime.
Regimes under review before revised methodology
All regimes for which no final conclusion was reached before the revised methodology is effective, will be
removed from the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and reviewed in accordance with all steps of the revised
methodology.
3 When a regime is kept “under review” by the FHTP, then no decision has yet been made. Publication includes public
release of the regime conclusions on the OECD website after the regime results have been approved and declassified
by the Inclusive Framework, as well as in FHTP Progress Reports, whichever is earlier.

Potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes
The revised methodology covers the BEPS impact assessment that is currently conducted as part of the
review of whether a regime is “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”. Therefore, this review, which
is condu cted when a regime has potentially harmful features based on the legislative review , is now
removed and replaced by the BEPS impact assessment under Step 4 of the revised methodology.
All regimes for which a “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” conclusion was reached, will remain
on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and will be added to the list of regimes for possible further
consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP can reconsider the regime at any given moment.
Disadvantaged areas regimes
Certain jurisdictions have introduced tax incentive regimes designed to encourage development in
disadvantaged areas and which, whilst they do not specifically provide a preferential treatment for income
from IP, they may include (or do not specifically exclude) such income. The BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD,
2015[2]) considered that such regimes do not pose significant BEPS -risks, provided the regime  is only
applicable to a relatively small and economically disadvantaged area, the regime is mainly  designed to
create new jobs and attract tangible investments , significant substance is demonstrated in terms of the
generation of new employment, assets and investments and  the regime is subject to monitoring by the
FHTP.
As for “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” regimes, the impact assessment under Step 4 of the
revised methodology now also considers whether a regime provides benefits to disadvantaged areas. The
FHTP will therefore no longer conclude a regime as a disadvantaged areas regime during the legislative
review. The current disadvantaged areas regimes will remain on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and
will be added to the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP
can reconsider the regime at any given moment.
Non-operational regimes
A preferential regime is not operational if the jurisdiction did not operationalise the regime and no taxpayer
is able to benefit from it. If such a regime becomes operational in the future, the jurisdiction has committed
to inform the FHTP and the regime will be reviewed.
All regimes that were concluded as non-operational before the revised methodology is effective, will remain
on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and will be added to the  list of regimes for possible further
consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP can reconsider the regime at any given moment.
Examples
The following list of non -exhaustive example s illustrates the practical application of the revised
methodology:
• Example 1: Jurisdiction A offers a preferential regime that is identified by Jurisdiction B (step 1).
The Secretariat undertakes an initial assessment (step 2) and concludes that no incom e from
geographically mobile activities can benefit from the regime. The Secretariat informs both
Jurisdiction A and Jurisdiction B and no further steps are taken. The regime is included in the list
of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
• Example 2: Jurisdiction C introduces a new IP regime. It identifies it to the Secretariat (step 1), and
the Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). Jurisdiction C
wishes to have an FHTP’s conclusion publi shed, because its stakeholders have requested this.
Jurisdiction C opts for the legislative review by the FHTP (step 3). The FHTP undertakes the
legislative review (step 5) and publishes the conclusion on the regime.
