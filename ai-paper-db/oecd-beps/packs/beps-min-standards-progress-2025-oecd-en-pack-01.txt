RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025
Introduction
In 2013, the project on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) was launched. Since then, the BEPS Project
has resulted in a major update to the international tax system  by equipping governments with rules and
instruments to ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities generating them take place and
where value is created.
Today, more than 145 jurisdictions are members of the  Inclusive Framework  on BEPS (the “Inclusive
Framework”), participating on an equal footing and working towards the development of a fair and
sustainable global tax environment. A key f unction of the Inclusive Framework is to monitor progress and
review the implementation of the four BEPS minimum standards that were identified as part of the 15-point
BEPS Action Plan published in 2013 (OECD, 2013[1]). Acknowledging their interdependence in addressing
BEPS-risks, Inclusive Framework jurisdictions commit to implement four BEPS minimum standards which
cover Action 5 on Harmful Tax Practices, Action 6 on Tax Treaty Abuse, Action 13 on Country-by-Country
Reporting, and Action 14 on Dispute Resolution.
Implementation of the four BEPS minimum standards has reached a mature stage , reflecting a strong
commitment to address BEPS risks across the membership of the Inclusive Framework. In light of this, the
focus of the work of the Inclusive Framework is now increasingly on making sure that all members – and
in particular developing countries – can fully benefit from the four minimum standards. To support this
objective, capacity building programmes and tailored technical assistance are being delivered to ensure
the swift, efficient and sustainable implementation of the BEPS project in all interested Inclusive
Framework member countries.
At the same time, attention has turned to reducing the burdens associated with the peer review processes,
which have now been running for a number of years,  and strengthening the overall value proposition of
the minimum standards . This work was initiated at the May 2024 Plenary meeting of the Inclusive
Framework in Paris and advanced further at Working Party level.
As a result of this work, the Inclusive Framework, at its April 2025 Plenary meeting in Cape Town, adopted
a series of recommendations to streamline the peer review processes for the BEPS minimum standards .
It also endorsed the proposal to introduce targeted adjustments to optimise the allocation of resources
among Inclusive Framework members, ensuring that efforts remain focused on areas of greatest impact ,
while preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the BEPS minimum standards.  Particular attention has
been given to strengthening the value proposition of the BEPS Project by identifying priority areas for
enhanced support , particularly with a  focus on improving access to Country-by-Country reports by
developing countries.
This note summarises the outcomes of this  work. It provides a brief overview of the current status of
implementation of each of the four minimum standards, outlines agreed measures to reduce burdens, and
Recognising progress and reducing
burdens in the BEPS minimum standards

highlights renewed priorities for the Inclusive Framework aimed at maintaining progress and future-
proofing the value proposition  of the BEPS Project , including by ensuring that all interested developing
countries can fully benefit from the work . The revised peer review methodology for BEPS Action 5 on
Harmful Tax Practices is included in the Annex to this report.
Looking ahead, the Inclusive Framework will continue to consolidate the progress  achieved so far by
optimising resource allocation within the  Inclusive Framework Secretariat and enhancing the support for
jurisdictions with limited resources. In addition, and as announced in the outcome statement of the Inclusive
Framework Plenary meeting in Cape Town, work is ongoing to take stock of the BEPS work to dat e, with
a comprehensive report expected to be presented in the last quarter of 2025.
BEPS Action 5 – Harmful Tax Practices
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard
The minimum standard on harmful tax practices  included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 5 (OECD,
2015[2]) requires Inclusive Framework jurisdictions to introduce substantial activity requirements f or
preferential regimes and enhance their tax transparency frameworks through the exchange of certain tax
rulings. Following the publication of the BEPS Final Report on Action 5  (OECD, 2015[2]), the Forum on
Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) reviewed and refined the framework for identifying harmful tax practices,
initially established in the 1998 Report  (OECD, 1998[3]), and decided to resume the substantial activities
factor for no or only nominal tax jurisdictions (OECD, 2018[4]).
Therefore, the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard encompasses three distinct workstreams. The first
focuses on preferential regimes based on criteria such as whether the regime is ring-fenced to exclude the
domestic market or presents a lack of transparency or substantial activit ies requirements. The second is
assessing no or only nominal corporate tax jurisdictions to ensure they enforce substantial activities
requirements, accompanied by certain exchange of information obligations for entities raising substance -
related concerns . T he third concerns the transparency framework for  the spontaneous exchange of
information on certain tax rulings.
Since the inception of the BEPS project, the FHTP has reviewed 332 preferential regimes for compliance
with Action 5, with 97% of those regimes having been abolished, amended or otherwise not posing a BEPS
risk – the remainder are under review or in the process of being amended or abolished. In 2025, the FHTP
undertook its eighth monitoring exercise for preferential regimes, and concluded that for most preferential
regimes, the BEPS risk in practice has decreased and jurisdictions have a transparent review mechanism
in place for ensuring compliance with substantial activities requirements.
With respect to no or only nominal tax jurisdictions, all of them have enacted legislation to meet the
substantial activit ies requirements. In this regard, the FHTP undertakes a monitoring exercise  for
substantial activities requirements in these jurisdictions, covering statistical data, compliance programme
and exchange of information. Almost all jurisdictions now meet these requirements. Presently, only one of
the 11 jurisdictions has a ‘hard recommendation’ to address in relation to its enforcement of these
requirements, and three others have ‘soft recommendations’ to certain issues (e.g. in respect of the
collection of statistics).
Regarding the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework on tax rulings , the FHTP conducted its eighth
annual peer review in 2024 that assessed 136 jurisdictions. Among them, 29 jurisdictions were found not
to have a legal or operational framework to issue rulings within the scope of the transparency framework .
A total of 104 jurisdictions did not receive any recommendations. A cumulative total of 58,000 exchanges
on 26,000 rulings has taken place since the implementation of the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework.
