(i) Break down of the average time taken to resolve post-2015 MAP cases into two
further groups: MAP cases closed under the unilateral stage and MAP cases closed
under the bilateral stage
21. Each jurisdiction should also report the aggregate average time taken to resolve post-2015 MAP
cases that are closed in a year in two additional groups, for each type of case:
 Average time taken for cases closed in the unilateral stage in aggregate (i.e. outcomes:  “denied
MAP access”, “objection is not justified” and “unilateral relief granted”); and
 Average time taken for cases closed in the bilateral stage in aggregate (i.e. all other outcomes).
22. The average time taken for cases in these categories would be calculated based on the “Start
Date” and “End Date” as agreed in this framewor k and matching of this data with the concerned treaty
partners is not required.
23. This data should be reported from the 2023 reporting year onwards and would be published as
described in Annex 3.B. A footnote has been added in this regard to note that this data is not subject to
matching and to provide clarity on how this data should be interpreted. Annex 3.D contains definitions of
terms and the rules relevant to this data point as well.
(ii) Identification of the age of pending post-2015 MAP cases
24. Each jurisdiction should also report the age of post-2015 MAP cases that are remaining in its MAP
inventory on 31 December of each year on an aggregate basis. This would be done by identifying the
aggregate number of such MAP cases that were initiated in different ranges of years, calculated based on
the “Start Date” as agreed in this framework and matching of this data with the concerned treaty partners
is not required.
This data should be reported from the 2023 reporting year onwards and would be published as de scribed
in Annex 3.B. A footnote has been added in this regard to note that this data is not subject to matching
and to provide clarity on how this data should be interpreted. Annex 3.D. contains definitions of terms and
the rules relevant to this data point as well.

minimum standard to make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective (“Terms of Reference”).

5 This MAP Statistics Reporting Framework  defines “start date” and “end date” for purposes of computing the time
taken to resolve a MAP case. These stat istical purposes should be distinguished from the purposes of timeframes in
arbitration provisions; the time frames relevant in that latter context must be determined based on the provisions of
the relevant arbitration clause and/or relevant competent authority agreements on the application of such clause.
6 For MAP requests received by a competent authority on or after 1 January 2016 but prior to 1 July 2016, the “start”
date shall be 5 weeks from the receipt of the taxpayer’s MAP request.
7 It is anticipated that, in transfer pricing cases, the competent authority of the jurisdiction raising the adjustment will
prepare the first position paper.

Annex 3.A. MAP Statistics reporting for the [YEAR] reporting period (1
January [YEAR] to 31 December [YEAR]) by [Name of Jurisdiction] for pre-
2016 cases closed in the [YEAR] reporting period
Annex A should be submitted to the Secretariat (email: fta.map@oecd.org) by 31 May of the calendar year following the year of the reporting period for subsequent publication on the
OECD website so long as there are pre-2016 cases in the jurisdiction’s MAP inventory on 1 January of the reporting year.
For countries that are currently reporting MAP statistics for publication on the OECD website (see: http://www.oecd.org/ctp/dispute/), with effect from the 2016 reporting period (1 January
2016 to 31 December 2016) they are only required to report MAP statistics for publication based on Annex A of this note.
Jurisdictions should report their MAP statistics for pre-2016 cases based on the definition of terms and rules for counting MAP cases as contained in Annex C.
