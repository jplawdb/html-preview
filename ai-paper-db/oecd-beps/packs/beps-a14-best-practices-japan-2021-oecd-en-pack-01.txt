handle the request and conduct negotiations with the treaty partner. 3 In this respect, Japan
noted that next to the request for a bilateral or multilateral APA, taxpayers are also required
to submit a MAP request on the basis of the MAP guidance (see element B.8  of the peer
review report for a discussion).
6. In relation to the filing of an APA request, Japan reported it encourages taxpayers to
have a pre -filing consultation with the competent department, such with a view to have a
common understanding of the request, to assist taxpayers in submitting the required
documentation efficiently and to expedite the APA process.4 Japan further reported that there
are no specific timelines for filing of APA requests and that no fees are charged to taxpayers.
However, an APA request needs to be filed on or before the commencing date of the first
taxable year for which the request is made. Where an APA request relates to fisca l years
2021-2024, the request thus has to be submitted on or before 1 January 2021. Typically, Japan
applies APAs for a period of three to five years.5
7. In view of the above, Japan annually publishes statistics relating to APAs on the
website of the National Tax Agency since 2006. These statistics can be found at (in English):6
https://www.nta.go.jp/english/map_report/index.htm
8. These statistics inter alia relate to the number of APA requests received, the number
of cases closed and the inventory of pending APA cases as per year-end. For calendar years
2014-2019 Japan reported the following statistics:7
Year Number bilateral
APA requests
Number of APAs
granted
Inventory per year-
end
2014 157 147 302
2015 161 106 357
2016 122 116 363
2017 157 152 368
2018 163 134 397
2019 110 115 392
9. Three peers provided input on this best practice. The first peer reported that Japan
has a well -developed bilateral APA programme. The second peer noted that it appreciates
Japan’s long-standing commitment to APAs, as being the most direct and viable means  for
preventing MAP cases and also to provide taxpayers with certainty. In this peer’s view the
commitment to concluded APAs with a meaningful level of prospectively is a best practice
that underlies the valuable promise of APAs to provide taxpayers with certainty on a going-
forward basis. In that regard, the peer respectfully welcomed additional discussions with
Japan’s competent authority in a co-operative and collaborative manner. Lastly, the third peer
echoed the previous input and noted it has a very positive relationship with Japan’s competent
authority, whereby contacts are considered easy and frequent, as also that Japan’s competent
authority provides quick responses. Such contacts take place in various manners such as e -
mail, letters and face-to-face meetings, whereby meetings are scheduled once or twice a year.
3  See chapter 6, section 12/13 of the Transfer Pricing Directive.
4  See chapter 6, section 10 of the Transfer Pricing Directive.
5  See chapter 6, section 7 of the Transfer Pricing Directive.
6  Statistics on APAs are also available in the annual report of the National Tax Agency. For 2018, these statistics are available in
Part III-3(4). Available at: http://www.nta.go.jp/english/Report_pdf/2018e_06.pdf.
7  The numbers reported in the table deviate slightly from the numbers included in the annual report issued by Japan’s National Tax Agency
due to the fact that in the latter the basis is the fiscal year, which in Japan runs from 1 July to 30 June.  Further, the numbers reported for
the year involves the period until 31 August 2019.

This peer further mentioned that in all pending MAP cases with Japan progress is made in a
reasonable time.
[BP.2] Publish mutual agreements of a general nature
Jurisdictions should have appropriate procedures in place to publish agreements reached by
competent authorities on difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application
of their tax treaties in appropriate cases.
10. Agreements reached by competent authorities to resolve difficulties or doubts arising
as to the interpretation or application of their tax treaties in relation to issues of a general
nature which concern, or may concern, a category of taxpayers reflect the competent
authorities’ mutual understanding of the m eaning of the convention and its terms. As such
agreements provide information that might be useful to prevent difficulties or doubts in the
interpretation or application of tax treaty provisions, publication of these agreements is
valuable.
11. Japan reported that it publishes agreements reached on difficulties or doubts arising
as to the interpretation or application of their tax treaties by the competent authorities. These
publications can be found on the website of Japan’s Ministry of Finance (in English) or of
the National Tax Agency (in Japanese) and are available at:
https://www.mof.go.jp/english/tax_policy/tax_conventions/press_release/index.htm
https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/kokusai/sonota/index.htm
12. In relation to the above, and as an example, Japan published mutual agreements
reached with Portugal (2013) and the United States (2005).8
13. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
1.1. [BP.3] Provide guidance on APAs
Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on APAs.
14. Guidance on a jurisdiction’s APA programme facilitates t he use of that programme
and creates awareness for taxpayers on how the APA process functions. As APAs may also
prevent future disputes from arising, including information on APAs in a jurisdiction’s MAP
guidance is relevant.
15. As previously mentioned under element BP.1, Japan has implemented an APA
programme and has issued specific guidance in relation to this programme in the form of the
Transfer Pricing Directive. This guidance in relation to APA procedure was lastly updated
on 16 February 2018 and is available online and can be found at (in English):
http://www.nta.go.jp/english/07.pdf
16. This guidance includes information on: Japan’s policy in respect of APAs, when and
by whom an APA can be requested,  the governmental department competent to handle APA
