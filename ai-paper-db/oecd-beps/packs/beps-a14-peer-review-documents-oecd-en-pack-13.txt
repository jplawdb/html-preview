65. The FTA MAP Forum shall ensure that the jurisdictions being reviewed in each year would include
jurisdictions with varying experience in MAP to minimise administrative workload for peers. The FTA MAP
Forum shall also ensure that jurisdictions that are undergoing or have undergone the simplified peer review
process that qualify for the full peer review process are then moved into the full peer review process in a
manner that allows them sufficient time to prepare.
66. In the event that the Action 14 minimum standard or Terms of Reference are revised in the future,
the full peer review process would be reviewed by the FTA MAP Forum to ensure that it aligns with the
revisions. If no such revisions are made by the time two full three -year peer review cycles are completed,
the FTA MAP Forum will consider a t that time  whether the full peer review process is working well or
requires review in the interest of adding further simplification and efficiency measures , including whether
full peer review reports may be replaced with update reports for more jurisdicti ons in the future.

2 For the purposes of this note, all references to members of the FTA MAP Forum should be read to mean members
of the FTA MAP Forum that have committed to the implementation of the Action 14 minimum standard.
3 The methodology proposed in this note would apply to reviews conducted in the context of the Inclusive Framework
for BEPS Implementation. The modalities for reviews of countries and jurisdictions of relevance, as identified by the
CFA, which have not joined the Inclusive Framework, will be agreed in due course by the CFA.
4 For the purposes of this note, non-members of the FTA MAP Forum refer to jurisdictions, including existing members
of the FTA MAP Forum, that have not committed to the implementation of the Action 14 minimum standard.

Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,

States.
6 Footnote by India: “India consistently opposed the  direct participation of taxpayers in the Peer Review process on
the principles that, (i) this was not part of the final report on Action 14 and (ii) taxpayers are not peers of sovereign
countries. However, in a spirit of compromise, India agreed for the i nclusion of taxpayers inputs as mentioned in this
document.”
7 Please see paragraph 7 above on the inclusive framework to broaden the participation in the OECD/G20 BEPS
Project.
8 For an assessed jurisdiction that did not submit an Update Report because th ere are no shortcomings identified in
its Stage 1 Peer Review report and no changes to its legislative or procedural framework relating to the implementation
of the minimum standard, its Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report would be updated with the statistics r eported by the
assessed jurisdiction pursuant to the agreed reporting framework.
9 Please note that the reference to “meaningful MAP experience” in this document is in reference to the defined term
that covers the conditions described in paragraph 42 and d oes not intend to objectively define as to when MAP
experience is meaningful in general.
10 All MAP cases would be counted for this calculation, irrespective of the year of introduction of the MAP request or
categorisation done for the purposes of the MAP Statistics.
11 “Year” refers to the latest available year of MAP Statistics published on the OECD website.
12 Please see footnote 6 in this regard where India’s concerns with respect to the consideration of taxpayer input in
the peer review process have been reflected.
13 The elements of the Terms of Reference connected to tax treaties are elements A.1, B.1, B.7, C.1 and D.3.
14 For example, if 52 jurisdictions qualify for the full peer review process, Year 1 would involve the peer reviews of 18
jurisdictions that would be completed by the end of the year; and Year 2 as well as Year 3 would similarly involve the
peer reviews of 17 jurisdictions respectively, following which Year 4 would be a gap year . The same set of jurisdictions
would be reviewed again in Years 5, 6 and 7 respectively with Year 8 being a gap year and this would continue.
15 Please see footnote 6 in this regard where India’s concerns with respect to the consideration of taxpayer input in
the peer review process have been reflected.
