4 Please note that this data has not been matched with the concerned treaty partners. In addition, please note that delays in individual MAP cases may be owing to several reasons,
many of them being out of the concerned competent authority’s control, and thus, the time taken in the unilateral and bilateral stages should not be seen in isolation of the overall
average time and inventory management.
