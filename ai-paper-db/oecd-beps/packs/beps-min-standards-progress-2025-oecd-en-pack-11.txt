nominal tax jurisdictions in scope of the standard, and performed a legislative review of their legislation for
the first time in 2019. When there are amendments in the legislation of a jurisdiction, the FHTP reviews
this too on a rolling basis.
In line with the FHTP’s standard on substantial activities in non -IP regimes (see above), the FHTP
introduced in 2019 an annual monitoring procedure for substantial activities requirements in no or only
nominal tax jurisdictions. As both monitoring processes are based on the same principles, to ensure the
level playing field, any change to the monitoring of reg imes should align the monitoring of no or only
nominal tax jurisdictions.
Like the annual monitoring for substantial activities in non-IP regimes detailed above, the annual monitoring
exercise for substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions incorporates, two
parts: the transparency review mechanis m and the statistical data.  The results of the monitoring are
focussed on statistical data, compliance programme and exchange of information. For these three areas,
it is assessed what the review mechanism is and if the statistical data is complete and doe s not present
any anomalies. The FHTP can give jurisdiction recommendations in these three areas, which can be hard
or soft recommendations.
Based on the annual monitoring results from the past years, it is apparent that  the focus of the monitoring
exercise is now mainly on the enforcement of the substance requirements and the robustness of the
compliance program in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions. Accordingly, and as for the substantial activities
in non-IP regimes, the FHTP’s focus on the monitoring for no or only nominal tax jurisdictions is increasingly
moving towards the monitoring of statistical data, mainly in respect of the compliance program and the
enforcement of the standard.
As the monitoring is now an established process, the Inclusive Fr amework concluded to decrease the
burden on the monitored jurisdictions and the FHTP by introducing a lower frequency in the review of the
substantial activities requirements in non or only nominal tax jurisdictions. Instead of an annual monitoring,
monitoring of these regimes will take place on a three -yearly basis. The FHTP will still collect data in
respect of each of the three years for which the monitoring is carried out.
Outside of the three-year cycle, an intermediate review of a particular jurisdiction can occur at any moment
in time when a reviewed jurisdiction requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented
swiftly. Generally, if significant issues for a specific no or only nominal tax jurisdiction are identified between
two cycles, an intermediate review of that jurisdiction can be initiated either at the request of an Inclusive
Framework member or by the Secretariat.
Peer review of the transparency framework
The BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]) includes a minimum standard on the spontaneous exchange
of information on tax rulings in respect of certain tax rulings that may create BEPS -risks (“transparency
framework”). The FHTP commenced a peer review process in 2017 which includes a review of  those
jurisdictions that can legally issue rulings in scope of the transparency framework. The review focusses on
the processes that the jurisdiction has in place on the identification of rulings in scope and exchange
jurisdictions, the exchange of inform ation process and the confidentiality requirements. It also takes into
account specific exchanges of information with respect to IP regimes that were identified in the BEPS
Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]).
Based on the statistics and recommendations resulting from the recent peer reviews of the transparency
framework, the Inclusive Framework  concluded that the peer review and the implementation of the
transparency framework is now an established process. Jurisdictions still issue and exchange rulings, but
most of them are doing this fully in line with the requirements of the transparency framework. As such, it
appears that it is no longer warranted to conduct a peer review on an annual basis in order to maintain the
progress made. In addition, the review of the transparency framework is now largely focussed on statistical

data on rulings and exchanges, rather than reviews of the required legal and administrative framework in
jurisdictions for identifying and exchanging rulings.
Therefore, the peer review of the transparency framework takes place once every three years, instead of
the current annual process. In addition, for those jurisdictions that have all elements of the legal and
administrative framework for identifying and exchanging rulings in place, the three-year peer review will be
based on a simplified questionnaire, focusing on statistical data. Outside of the three -yearly cycle, an
intermediate review of a particular jurisdiction can occur at any moment in time when a reviewed jurisdiction
requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented swiftly.
Summary
The agreed changes to the FHTP’s scope and frequency of annual monitoring and peer review exercises
can be summarised as follows:
• Monitoring of preferential regimes:
o no more monitoring of (i) third category of IP assets and rebuttable presumption in IP regimes,
(ii) potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes, (iii) disadvantaged areas regimes, and
(iv) grandfathered non-IP regimes; and
o monitoring of substantial activities requirements in non-IP regimes to occur every three years,
subject to intermediate reviews in case of improvements or significant issues.
• Monitoring of substantial activities in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions:
o to occur every three years, subject to intermediate reviews in case of improvements or
significant issues.
• Peer review of the transparency framework on rulings:
o to occur every three years on the basis of a simplified questionnaire for jurisdictio ns with the
legal and operational framework in place, subject to intermediate reviews in case of
improvements.
Practically, the above conclusions on the frequency of the peer reviews translate into the following
schedule:
Workstream Frequency Which years
Monitoring of no or only nominal tax jurisdictions Once every three years 2026, 2029, etc.
Peer review transparency framework Once every three years 2027, 2030, etc.
Monitoring of certain aspects of regimes Once every three years 2028, 2031, etc.
Review of the revised methodology
The FHTP will review the revised methodology to assess whether it efficiently operates for addressing
BEPS risks under BEPS Action 5. This review will take place after the first three -year cycle for all three
workstreams has been completed.
