Introduction
The final report on BEPS Action 14: “Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More
Effective” identified a number of best practices related to the three general objectives of the
Action 14 Minimum Standard.
Paragraph 9 of the Terms of Reference to monitor and review the implement ation of the
BEPS Action 14 Minimum Standard to make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective1
stipulates that:
The best practices are not part of the minimum standard and whether or not  a
jurisdiction has implemented the best practices will not be peer reviewed or
monitored, nor will it affect the assessment of the assessed jurisdiction. Jurisdictions
are free, however, to identify best practices they have adopted.
Japan has provided information and requested feedback by peers on how it has adopted best
practices. In that regard, the FTA MAP Forum agreed on an optional best practices feedback
form that peers have used to provide feedback on Japan’s adoption of the best practices.
The peer review process on the implementation of the Action 14 Minimum Standard consists
of two stages: a peer review process (stage 1) and a peer monitoring process (stage 2). Stage
2 is launched within one year upon the adoption of the peer review report  by the BEPS
Inclusive Framework through an update report by Japan. This document contains a general
overview of the adoption of best practices and comments by peers on the adoption of these
best practices during stage 1 (period ranging from 1 January 2015 up to 31 December 2017)
and stage 2 (ranging from 1 January 2018 up to 31 August 2019).
1  Terms of reference to monitor and review the implementing of the BEPS Action 14 Minimum Standard to make dispute resolution
mechanisms more effective (CTPA/CFA/NOE2(2016)45/REV1).

Part A
Preventing Disputes
[BP.1] Implement bilateral APA programmes
Jurisdictions should implement bilateral APA programmes.
1. APAs concluded bilaterally between competent authorities provide an increased level
of certainty in both jurisdictions, lessen the likelihood of double taxation and may proactively
prevent transfer pricing disputes.
2. Japan reported that it has implemented an APA programme, which it has run since
1987 and which allows unilateral, bilateral and multilateral APAs. These types of APAs can
be applied both for determining the arm’s length price of transactions between associated
enterprises and for the attribution of profits to permanent establishments. As will be discussed
in more detail under element BP.3, Japan has included in chapter 6 of the Commissioner’s
Directive on the operation of transfer pricing (‘ Transfer Pricing Directive ’) detailed
information on its APA programme.
3. Further to the above, Japan noted that in addition to its APA programme, the Regional
Taxation Bureaus  of the National Tax Agency  have since June 2017 started accepting
enquiries from taxpayers in relation to transfer pricing documentation. This programme has
specifically been introduced to ensure and enhance taxpayers’ voluntary tax compliance, also
with a view to further prevent disputes.
4. Where it concerns unilateral APAs, the competence to handle APA requests is
assigned to the National Tax Agency, and sub -mandated to the R egional Commissioner
Large Enterprise Examination Division of the Regional Taxation Bureau, or t o the District
Director of the Examination Group (Corporation) of the Tax Office, such dependent on which
department has jurisdiction over the taxpayer submitti ng the APA request. 2 Contact details
for each department are made available online in Japanese and can be found at:

https://www.nta.go.jp/about/organization/index.htm
5. Where an APA request concerns a bilateral or multilateral APA, it is the Regional
Tax Bureau’s Large Enterprise Examination Division that will conduct the initial review of
the APA request. However, where such a request is made under the MAP provision of a tax
treaty, it is MAP office that will – in co-operation with the Regional Tax Bureau – further
