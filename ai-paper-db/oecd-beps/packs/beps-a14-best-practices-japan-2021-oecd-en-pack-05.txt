48. As mentioned under BP.5, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the OECD Model Tax
Convention taxpayers are allowed to submit a MAP request irrespective of available domestic
remedies. This, however, does not further specify how to proceed if both available remedies
are initiated and the case is dealt with in the bilateral phase of the MAP. Publicly available
guidance on the relationship between the MAP and domestic r emedies provides clarity to
taxpayers as well as treaty partners.
49. Japan included information on the relationship between MAP and domestic law
administrative and judicial remedies in the note attached to section 3(1) of its MAP guidance.
This note clearly stipulates that taxpayers are allowed to submit a MAP request under a tax
treaty, such regardless of the fact whether the taxpayer  (or its foreign affiliated person)  has
initiated administrative or judicial remedies in respect of the taxes that are subject of the MAP
request. The same information is included in the response to question 2.11 of the Q&A on
MAP. This response further specifies that where the court in Japan has already decided on a
case, its competent authority will follow that decision in its MAP negotiations with the other
competent authority concerned. The response to question 2.8 of this Q&A further specifies
that no fees are charged to taxpayers when submitting a MAP request. Furthermore, section
5(1) of the MAP guidance notes that taxpayers  can ask for a pre -filing meeting before
submitting a MAP request. The response to question 2.3 of the Q&A on MAP also includes
information hereon.
50. One peer provided input on this best practice. It noted that in its experience Japan’s
competent authority has continuously made robust efforts to facilitate the opportunity for
taxpayers to make use of MAP to avoid, or otherwise reduce, instances of double taxation.
However, the peer also shared the view that in its belief taxpayers and competent authorities
would benefit from enhanced efforts by Japan’s competent authority to provide guidance to
taxpayers concerning those situations where, in its view, the application of Japan’s domestic
law forestalls reliance on MAP to eliminate cases of double taxation. To this the peer added
that it respectfully welcomes additional discussions with Japan’s competent authority on the
scope within which such situations should occur and on the best practices for addressing them
in a collaborative and co-operative manner.
[BP.11] Provide guidance on consideration of interest and penalties in MAP
Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on the consideration of
interest and penalties in the mutual agreement procedure.
51. As interests and penalties may concern su bstantial amounts, providing clarity in a
jurisdiction’s MAP guidance on whether interest and penalties are in the scope of the MAP
is relevant to ensure that a taxpayer is well-informed on this issue.
52. Japan reported it does not take interest and/or penalties into consideration in MAP.
However, where a MAP agreement requires an adjustment to be made in Japan, leading to a
reduction of the taxable income, then Japan will reduce interest and/or penalties in proportion
to such an adjustment on the moment of implementing the MAP agreement. Japan’s position
on the consideration of interest and penalties in MAP , that the competent authority would
explain to the taxpayer the application of interests and penalties to the MAP agreement,  is
discussed in the note attached to Section 16(1) of the MAP guidance.
53. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.

[BP.12] Include Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention in tax treaties
Jurisdictions should include paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention in
their tax treaties.
54. Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2017) allows competent
authorities to make a corresponding adjustment to unilaterally eliminate double ta xation
arising from primary adjustments. Including this provision in tax treaties provides taxpayers
the possibility to obtain the elimination of such double taxation via a unilateral corresponding
adjustment.
55. Japan reported that it is in favour of including Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax
Convention (OECD, 2017) in its tax treaties where possible and that it will seek to include
this provision in all of its future tax treaties.
Overview of tax treaties
56. Out of Japan’s 71 tax treaties, 19 contain a provision equivalent to Article 9(2) of the
OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2017) requiring their state to make a correlative
adjustment in case a transfer pricing adjustment is imposed by the treaty partner.  17
Furthermore, 20 tax treaties do not contain a provision that is based on or equivalent to Article
9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), six of which does not contain in
its entirety a provision that is based on Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD,
2017) with regard to associated enterprises.18 The remaining 32 treaties do contain a provision
that is based on Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), but deviate
from this provision for the following reasons:
 In 31 corresponding adjustments can only be made through a consultation between
the competent authorities; and
 In one treaty granting of a corresponding adjustment is optional, as the phrase “(…)
shall make an appropriate adjustment” is replaced by “(….) may, where appropriate,
make an appropriate adjustment”.
Recent developments
Bilateral modifications
57. Japan signed a new tax treaty with a treaty partner that concerns the replacement of
an existing treaty currently in force. This newly signed treaty has n ot yet entered into force,
but Japan has already ratified it. This treaty contains a provision that is equivalent to Article
9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017) , which was not the case for the
existing treaty currently in force. Further, Japan signed new tax treaties with six treaty
partners which are newly negotiated treaties with treaty partners with which there were no
17 These 19 treaties include the newly negotiated treaty with Spain which will replace the currently existing treaty with this
jurisdiction of 1974 and the newly negotiated treaty with Uzbekistan, for which Japan currently continues to apply the  treaty
with the former USSR of 1986 and that it will no longer do so upon entry into force of this new treaty.
18 These 20 treaties include the treaty with former Czechoslovakia that Japan continues to apply to the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic and these six treaties include the treaty with the former USSR that Japan continues to apply to Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine.
