(ii) The manner and form in which the taxpayer should submit its MAP request – MAP guidance
should clearly state any requir ements with respect to the format of a request, including whether
paper or electronic forms should be used and the required language of the request and any
accompanying documentation. In addition, MAP guidance should include any requirements relating
to th e timing of the submission of a MAP request (other than the timeframe stipulated in the
applicable MAP provision), for example, a requirement that if the taxpayer is intending to submit
the same MAP request to another competent authority, then the two requests should be submitted
at the same time. MAP guidance should also require a taxpayer to clearly indicate in its MAP
request if its request is a “protective” MAP request2.
5. To facilitate the review of a MAP request, a jurisdiction’s MAP guidance should cle arly list the
information and documentation that should be submitted with a taxpayer’s request for MAP assistance.
The information and documentation to be included in the taxpayer’s MAP request could include, for
example, the following:
(i) Identity of the taxpayer(s) covered in the MAP request – the identity of the taxpayer(s) covered
in a MAP request must be sufficiently specific to allow the competent authority to identify and
contact the taxpayer(s) involved. The information provided should include the name , address,
taxpayer identification number or birth date, contact details and the relationship between the
taxpayers covered in the MAP request (where applicable).
(ii) The basis for the request  – the MAP request should state the specific tax treaty including th e
provision(s) of the specific article(s) which the taxpayer considers is not being correctly applied by
either one or both Contracting Party (and to indicate which Party and the contact details of the
relevant person(s) in that Party).
(iii) Facts of the case  – the MAP request should contain all the relevant facts of the case including
any documentation to support these facts, the taxation years or period involved and the amounts
involved (in both the local currency and foreign currency).
(iv) Analysis of the issue(s ) requested to be resolved via MAP  – the taxpayer should provide an
analysis of the issue(s) involved, including its interpretation of the application of the specific treaty
provision(s), to support its basis for making a claim that the provision of the sp ecific tax treaty is
not correctly applied by either one or both Contracting Party. The taxpayer should support its
analysis with relevant documentation (for example, documentation required under transfer pricing
legislative or published guidance, copies o f tax assessments, audits conducted by the tax
authorities leading to the incorrectly application of the tax treaty provision).
(v) Whether the MAP request was also submitted to the competent authority of the other
Contracting Party – If so, the MAP request should make this clear, together with the date of such
submission, the name and the designation of the person or the office to which the MAP request
was submitted. A copy of that submission (including all documentations filed with that submission)
should also be provided unless the content of both MAP submissions are exactly the same.
(vi) Whether the MAP request was also submitted to another authority under another Instrument
that provides for a mechanism to resolve treaty -related disputes – If yes, the MAP reque st
should clearly state so and the date of such submission, the name and the designation of the
person or the office to which the MAP request was submitted, should be provided. A copy of that
submission (including all documentations filed with that submission) should also be provided unless
the content of both MAP submissions are exactly the same.
(vii) Whether the issue(s) involved were previously dealt with  – the request should state whether
the issue(s) presented in the MAP request has been previously dealt wi th, for example, in an
advance ruling, advance pricing arrangement, settlement agreement or by any tax tribunal or court.
If yes, a copy of these rulings, agreements or decisions should be provided.

(viii) A statement confirming that all information and documenta tion provided in the MAP
request is accurate and that the taxpayer will assist the competent authority in its resolution
of the issue(s) presented in the MAP request by furnishing any other information or
documentation required by the competent authority in a timely manner – the request for any
other information or documentation should be well -targeted and responses to the request should
be complete and be submitted within the time stipulated in the request for such information or
documentation.

1 See minimum standard 3.2 in the 2015 Action 14 Report and elements B.6. and B.8. of the Terms of Reference to

mechanisms more effective (“Terms of Reference”).
2 A “protective” MAP request is understood as a MAP request submitted by the taxpayer to ensure that its request is
made within the time frame provided under the tax treaty but the taxpayer has indicated at the point of making the
request or subsequently to the competent authority that the request need not be examined until further notification
from the taxpayer to do so.
