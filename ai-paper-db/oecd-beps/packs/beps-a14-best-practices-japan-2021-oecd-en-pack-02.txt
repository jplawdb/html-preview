does not substantially deviate from the general APA guidance discussed in paragraphs 15

21. Japan reported that it has carried out an update to its Transfer Pricing Directive in
February 2018 in respect of (i) the procedure applicable where taxpay ers are required to
submit additional information and (ii) the procedure applicable where the APA process is
deferred or closed in exceptional cases. Accordingly, corresponding updates were also made
to the Commissioner’s Directives mentioned above in respect of specific taxpayers.
22. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
[BP.4] Develop “global awareness” of the audit/examination functions
Jurisdictions should develop the “global awareness” of the audit/examination functions
involved in international matters through the delivery of the Forum on Tax Administration’s
“Global Awareness Training Module” to appropriate personnel.
23. Making audit/examination function of tax administrations that are involved in
international matters aware of: (i) the potential for creating double taxation, (ii) the impact of
a proposed adjustment on the tax base of one or more jurisdictions and (iii) the process and
principles by which competing juridical claims are reconciled by competent authorities, may
be useful to prevent disputes from arising. Using the Global Awareness Training Module
developed by the Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) can be helpful in this respect.
24. Japan reported that the National Tax Agency provides training to officials in
audit/examination functions through its National Tax College. This college provides trainings
to learn these officials about relevant tax laws and auditing skills. In relation to dispute
resolution, two training programmes are relevant:
 International Training Course: a four month course that aims at providing officials
basic knowledge and advance expertise concerning examinations of international
transactions and other practical work concerning international taxation. 12 In more
detail, the curriculum of the course consist of teaching : (i) international tax laws
(including tax treaties), (ii) examination methods for international transactions and
(iii) rules and practices concerning international trade; and
 Corresponding training courses : part of these courses concerns International
Taxation I and II, which aim at providing officials with knowledge and skills in the
field of international taxation.13 The training consists of assignments as a preparation
to the course and several days of lecture.
25. Further to the a bove, Japan reported that each division of the Regional Taxation
Bureaus organises one day or short-term training sessions for auditors. An example hereof is
the transfer pricing division, which gives trainings to all auditors in that division to update
their knowledge in light of recent modifications of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines,

domestic laws and directives. In addition, Japan noted that t he essence of the Global
Awareness Training Module is shared among auditors through those trainings.
26. One peer provided input on this best practice and mentioned that Japan has been a
committed partner within the FTA MAP Forum as also in the FTA’s Large Business
Programme with a view to raise awareness of the principles of the Global Awareness Training
Module at the level of its examination function and at the competent authority level. To this
the peer added that it also appreciates the willingness of Japan’s competent authority to
discuss the use of “reference sets” of comparable companies in cases presenting common fact
patterns and transfer pricing issues. In this peer’s view such reference sets provide for a useful
tool for the efficient and consistent resolution of MAP/APA cases with Japan’s competent
authority. In that regard it appreciates the opportunity to discuss these reference sets and other
ideas with Japan with a view to improve current practices concerning the resolution of cases.
