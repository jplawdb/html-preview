 List of information and documentation required for a MAP request
 Recommendations
MAP profile
 Whether the jurisdiction has published a MAP profile and if yes, date of last update
 Brief evaluation if the MAP profile is complete and whether contents of MAP profile reflect reported
practice
 Recommendations
4. MAP statistics
 Whether the jurisdiction has submitted MAP statistics on time and has done matching of MAP
statistics with treaty partners
 Where the jurisdiction is involved in MAP cases, whether such juri sdiction has closed MAP cases
within the targeted average timeframe of 24 months and whether the MAP statistics suggest that
the jurisdiction has sufficient resources in its competent authority function
 Recommendations
5. Practical application of the Action 14 minimum standard
 A brief review of the jurisdiction’s policy regarding MAP from the MAP guidance/MAP profile (in
general as well as tailored to specific elements of the Terms of Reference  concerning transfer
pricing cases, anti-abuse cases, audit settlements etc.) along with any practical application based
on the jurisdiction’s reporting and the peer input received to see if policy/practice in general are in
line with the Action 14 minimum standard

Introduction
1. The Report on Action 14: Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective  (“the 2015
Action 14 Report ”) (OECD, 2015[1]) was approved by the OECD Committee of Fiscal Affairs (“ CFA”) in
September, presented to the OECD Council and endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers on 8 October
2015. This Report contained a commitment by countries engaged in the work to the implementation of a
minimum standard to ensure that they resolve treaty -related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient
manner and to have their compliance with the minimum standard reviewed by their peers – i.e. the other
members of the Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum (“the FTA MAP Forum”).
2. One of the elements of the minimum standard 1 requires jurisdictions to seek to resolve mutual
agreement procedure (“MAP”) cases within an average timeframe of 24 month s. To monitor compliance
with this, jurisdictions’ progress toward meeting this target will be periodically reviewed on the basis of the
statistics prepared in accordance with an agreed reporting framework. The 2015 Action 14 Report (OECD,
2015[1]) explains that the reporting framework will include agreed milestones for the initiation and
conclusion/closing of a MAP case, as well as other relevant stages of the MAP process. The minimum
standard also requires jurisdictions to provide timely and complete reporting of MAP statistics, pursuant to
the agreed reporting framework.
3. The agreed reporting framework is set out in this note. Section II describes the MAP process to
the extent it is relevant for MAP Statistics reporting purposes, in particular focusing on the relevant
milestones. Section III sets out the statistics reporting templates for the reporting and publication of MAP
case inventory and MAP outcomes, and the average time taken for each of the key stages of the  MAP
process, including the definition of terms used.
4. As part of the 2020 Review of the Action 14 minimum standard, the Inclusive Framework reviewed
this reporting framework with a view to collecting additional data on the MAP process. Accordingly, it was
agreed that jurisdictions would report the additional data points listed below as part of their annually
reported MAP Statistics from the 2023 reporting year onwards. In line with the 2015 Action 14 report
(OECD, 2015[1]), some of this additional data would facilitate a more in -depth review of jurisdictions’ MAP
practices and would provide transparency with respect to each reporting jurisdiction’s MAP programme as
well as a comprehensive picture of the overall state of the MAP in all of the reporting jurisdictions. However,
due care has also been taken to avoid onerous reporting obligations and to only focus on additional data
that would provide benefits without imposing excessive resource burdens. These additional data points
are described in detail in Section IV below.
