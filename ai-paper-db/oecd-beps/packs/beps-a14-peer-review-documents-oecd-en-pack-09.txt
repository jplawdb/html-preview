Approval of the Stage 1 Peer Review report of an assessed jurisdiction by the FTA MAP
Forum
22. The draft Stage 1 Peer Review reports of all assessed jurisdictions will be circulated to the FTA
MAP Forum at least 6 weeks prior to the Forum meeting , for approval under the written procedure . For
each draft report, the Secretariat will inform the Forum as to whether the assessed jurisdiction and its peers
that have raised issues on the assessed jurisdiction’s compliance with the minimum standard  agree with
the outcomes of its review. Where a jurisdiction has failed to provide full responses to the questionnaire
and any supplementary questions by the deadlines set out in the Assessment Methodology, and this has
resulted in it not being possible to  conduct an effective review within the required time frame, this will be
highlighted to the Forum.
23. Members of the FTA MAP Forum should submit to the Secretariat any written comments or
objections to a draft report within 3 weeks of receipt. Members should explain clearly the basis for their
comments or objections so that the Secretariat has a proper appreciation of them. Where there are no
written comments or objections to a draft report, that draft report will be considered to be approved by the
FTA MAP Forum under written procedure. Where there are written comments or objections to a draft report,
the draft report will be included on the agenda for the FTA MAP Forum meeting for discussion. At least
1 week before the meeting, the Secretariat will send to the FTA MAP Forum a list of Stage 1 Peer Review
reports that were approved by the FTA MAP Forum via written procedure, a compilation of the objections
and written comments received and the Secretariat’s proposed response , and the amended draft reports
incorporating the proposed changes for discussion at the FTA MAP Forum.
24. At the FTA MAP Forum meeting, the Secretariat will present the key issues relating to each draft
report on the agenda, including objections and comments received from members of the Forum,  and any
changes that have been made to the draft report in order to take these into account. The assessed
jurisdiction will also have the opportunity to raise any comments it has with respect to the outcomes of its
review, and address any concerns or ques tions raised by other members of the Forum. The Forum will
then discuss the issues raised with respect to the draft report , agree any changes that should be made
and approve the revised report. In cases where the differences or disagreement on the draft re port arise
from technical issues relating to the implementation of the minimum standard, the FTA MAP Forum shall,
where necessary, request the appropriate Working Party of the CFA to provide its view on the issue under
dispute for the FTA MAP Forum’s consideration in the discussion of the report.
25. Following the approval of the Stage 1 Peer Review reports by the FTA MAP Forum, the Secretariat
shall invite the FTA MAP Forum to approve the FTA MAP Forum Report  comprising three sections a s
follows, for publication:
 Section I which sets out the purpose and background to the monitoring and peer review process;
 Section II which provides an executive summary on the main conclusions based on the Stage 1
Peer Review reports on assessed jurisdictions as approved; and
 Section III which contains the individual Stage 1 Peer Review reports on the assessed jurisdictions
as approved.
Any comments on the FTA MAP Forum Report should be limited to Section I and II of the report given that
the individual reports in Section III were already approved by the FTA MAP Forum.
C. Adoption of FTA MAP Forum Report on Stage 1 Peer Review reports by the CFA
for publication
26. Following the approval of the FTA MAP Forum Report by the FTA MAP Forum, it will be sent to
the CFA7 within 1 week. In the exceptional circumstances that the FTA MAP Forum was unable to approve
the report on an assessed jurisdiction, or where an effective review of an assessed jurisdiction was not

possible (for example, where the assessed jurisdiction did not provide fu ll responses to the questionnaire
and supplementary questions), this will be highlighted to the CFA together with an explanation on why the
FTA MAP Forum has been unable to approve the report, or why an effective review of an assessed
jurisdiction was not possible.
27. The CFA will be invited to adopt the FTA MAP Forum Report for publication via written procedure.
In the absence of any written objections within 2 weeks, the report is considered to be adopted. If there
are written objections on the report, the Chair of the CFA shall decide via written procedure if the FTA MAP
Forum should examine the objection and submit its proposal to the CFA for consideration via written
procedure or the objection shall be discu ssed at the next meeting of the CFA . Following the adoption of
the FTA MAP Report by the CFA, it shall be published as soon as possible.
D. Monitoring of measures taken by assessed jurisdiction to improve the MAP
regime (Stage 2 Peer Monitoring)
28. The key objective of the monitoring and peer review of a jurisdiction’s compliance with the
minimum standard is to help the jurisdiction identify areas where it can improve to achieve an efficient and
effective MAP process. In this regard, it is important for both the FTA MAP Forum and the assessed
jurisdiction to follow up on the recommendations in the Stage 1 Peer Review report to address the
shortcomings identified and to publicly acknowledge progress made by the assessed jurisdiction. This
section of the note describes the procedure for conducting the Stage 2  Peer Monitoring of an assessed
jurisdiction.
Approval of Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report of an assessed jurisdiction
29. An assessed jurisdiction should within one year of the adoption of its Stage 1 Peer Review report
by the CFA submit a detailed written report (“Update Report”) to the FTA MAP Forum of (i) the steps it
has taken or is taking to address any shortcomings identified in its peer review report; and (ii) any plans or
changes to its legislative or procedural framework relating to the implementation of the minimum standard.
An assessed jurisdiction could also include in the Update Report any other plans or changes to the
implementation of its MAP regime since its Stage 1 Peer Review report. The Update Report should be
provided in English or French and in an electronic format.
30. Members of the FTA MAP Forum should provide their comments on the Update Report provided
by the assessed jurisdiction within 4 weeks from the receipt of that report. Comments provided by its peers
shall be in English or French and in an electronic format and will be made available to the assessed
jurisdiction and the assessed jurisdiction should address any issues raised by its peers in its response to
the Secretariat within 4 weeks from receipt of the comments.
31. Based on the Update Report submitted by the assessed jurisdiction, inputs from the peers, the
statistics reported by the assessed jurisdiction pursuant to the agreed reporting framework, the Secretariat
will revise the Stage 1 Peer review report of the assessed jurisdiction with a view to incorporate these
updates in the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report of the assessed jurisdiction.8
32. Where comments were provided by the peers of the assessed jurisdiction, this draft Stage 2 Peer
Monitoring report will be sent to the assessed jurisdiction and its peers that have raise d issues on the
assessed jurisdiction’s compliance with the minimum standard within 4 weeks of receipt of the assessed
jurisdiction’s response to comments from its peers. The assess ed jurisdiction should provide any written
comments on the draft report within 6 weeks of receipt, including confirmation of whether it agrees with its
draft Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report. The peer should inform the Secretariat whether the draft Stage 2
Peer Monitoring report addresses the issues it raised within 4 weeks of receipt. The Secretariat, the
assessed jurisdiction and its peers shou ld take all reasonable steps to resolve any differences or
disagreements regarding the draft Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report.
