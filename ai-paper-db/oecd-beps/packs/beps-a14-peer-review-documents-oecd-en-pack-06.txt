BEPS ACTION 14 ON MORE EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS – PEER REVIEW DOCUMENTS © OECD 2023
Introduction
1. The Action 14 BEPS Report: Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective - 2015 Final
Report (“the 2015 Action 14 Report”) (OECD, 2015[1]) was approved by the OECD Committee on Fiscal
Affairs (“CFA”) in September, presented to the OECD Council and endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers
at their meeting on 8 October 2015. 1 The 2015 Action 14 Report (OECD, 2015[1]) contains a commitment
by countries engaged in the work to make important changes in their approach to dispute resoluti on. In
particular, these countries commit to the implementation of a minimum standard (“the minimum standard”)
to ensure that they resolve treaty -related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner and to have
their compliance with the minimum standard reviewed by their peers – i.e. the other members of the Forum
on Tax Administration MAP Forum 2 (“the FTA MAP Forum” or “the Forum”). The FTA MAP Forum brings
together all OECD and G20 countries and will be open to all jurisdictions that commit to the  minimum
standard. All members of the Forum will participate in the work on an equal footing. This review will be
conducted through a peer-based monitoring mechanism that will report regularly to the G20.
2. In accordance with the mandate contained in the 2015 Action 14 Report (OECD, 2015[1]), the CFA,
through its Working Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questions (“ Working Party 1”) and the
FTA MAP Forum will develop the Terms of Reference  and Assessment Methodology3 for the monitoring
and peer review of the implementation of the minimum standard. The peer reviews will include an
evaluation of the legal framework provided by the jurisdiction’s tax treaties and domestic law and
regulations, and its MAP programme guidance. The minimum standard is also complemented by a set of
best practices.
3. The peer review and monitoring of the implementation of the minimum standard by members of
the FTA MAP Forum and non-members4 identified by the Forum as relevant to this work will be conducted
by the FTA MAP Forum. The process begins in 2016 with the objective of publishing the first reports in the
second half of 2017.
4. The Assessment Methodology contained in this note establishes detailed procedures and
guidelines for a 2-stage approach to peer review and monitoring of the implementation of the minimum
standard. Stage 1 involves the review of the assessed jurisdiction’s implementation of the minimum
standard based on the jurisdiction’s legal framework for MAP and the application of this f ramework in
practice (“Stage 1 Peer Review ”). Stage 2 involves the review of the measures taken by the assessed
jurisdiction to address any shortcomings identified in its Stage 1 Peer Review (“Stage 2 Peer Monitoring”).
The review of non-members of the FTA MAP Forum will occur in a manner similar to the review of members
to the greatest extent possible. While participation of non -members should be encouraged, it is important

that the review of non -members be based on best available infor mation in the absence of such
participation.
5. The Assessment Methodology contained in this note should be reviewed by 2020 in light of the
experience in conducting peer monitoring, keeping in mind the need for an Assessment Methodology which
effectively improves the shortcomings identified in the peer review reports with the aim of ensuring an
effective MAP regime to benefit both governments and taxpayers.
Peer Review and Monitoring process
6. All OECD and G20 countries, and other jurisdictions which have com mitted to the minimum
standard, will work collectively to improve the effectiveness of the MAP by becoming members of the FTA
MAP Forum . To assist members in improving the effectiveness of their MAP regime, every member’s
compliance with the minimum standa rd will be reviewed by other members of the Forum, in accordance
with an assessment schedule to be developed by the FTA MAP Forum. The FTA MAP Forum should take
into consideration the MAP experience and the MAP inventory  of jurisdictions in the scheduling of their
review, including whether jurisdictions already compile statistical information relating to MAP or published
their MAP profile.
7. The assessment schedule should ensure that the Stage 1 Peer Reviews begin in 2016 and that
the Stage 1 Peer Review of all 44 countries5 that have committed to the BEPS outputs starts no later than
end 2018. Furthermore, any country or jurisdiction that participates as BEPS Associates in an extension
of the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs (CFA) under the framework where BEPS Associates will work
on an equal footing with the OECD and G20 members on the remaining standard-setting under the BEPS
Project, as well as the review and monitoring of the implementation of the BEPS package, will also undergo
the same peer review and monitoring process . However, the MAP Forum should defer the review of any
such member that is a developing country and is not an OECD or G20 country if that member has not yet
encountered meaningful levels of MAP requests and there is no feedback from other members of the FTA
MAP Forum indicating that the jurisdiction’s MAP regime requires improvement. In any case, all members
of the FTA MAP Forum should report statistics in accordance with the agreed framework for reporting of
MAP statistics and publish their MAP Profiles on a shared public platform pursuant to the agreed template.
In addition, the assessment schedule should ensure that the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring of all 44 countries
that have committed to the BEPS outputs be completed by 2020.
8. The Stage 1 Peer Review and Stage 2 Peer Monitoring will be desk-based and will be co-ordinated
by the Secretariat of the FTA MAP Forum (“the Secretariat”). This section contains details concerning the
methodology for conducting these reviews as follows:
 Part A – Obtaining inputs for the Stage 1 Peer Review
 Part B – Drafting and approval of a Stage 1 Peer Review report
 Part C – Publication of Stage 1 Peer Review reports
 Part D – Monitoring of measures taken by assessed jurisdiction to improve the MAP regime (i.e.
Stage 2 Peer Monitoring)
9. A flowchart summary of the Stage 1 Peer Review and Stage 2 Peer Monitoring process is attached
in Annex 2.A. and Annex 2.B. respectively and the model assessment schedule for conducting these
reviews is attached in Annex 2.C.
A. Obtaining inputs for the Stage 1 Peer Review
10. This section of the note describes the mechanisms and procedures to obtain inputs for the Stage
1 Peer Review of an assessed jurisdiction.
