RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens
In light of the maturity of the BEPS Action 5 implementation, the Inclusive Framework discussed in 2024 a
renewed fo cus that prioritises burden reduction of the FHTP’s processes , particularly for developing
countries, and aims to support tax administrations by enabling a more efficient use of resources within both
jurisdictions and the FHTP Secretariat.
Building on thes e discussions, t he Inclusive Framework approved at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 a
revised methodology designed to reduce the burden and frequency of peer review processes while
preserving the advancements  made in countering harmful tax competition . The FHTP will now apply a
methodology for regime reviews that introduces an upfront economic impact assessment on the expected
BEPS risks, prior to the legislative review. As a result, preferential regimes that are unlikely to create BEPS
risks will no longer undergo a legislative review by the FHTP, unless explicitly requested by jurisdictions in
light of the impact assessment.
This procedural change streamlines the FHTP's work and enhances its focus on regimes that are
significant for maintaining the integrity of the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard and ensuring a level playing
field, without requiring jurisdictions to make legislative changes where such changes are not necessary to
address BEPS risks.
In addition, the Inclusive Framework agreed on a reduced frequency of the FHTP’s monitoring
workstreams. The monitoring exercises for substantial activities in non-IP regimes and no or only nominal
tax jurisdictions as well as the peer review of the transparency framework will now take place once every
three years, instead of annually.
The full revised methodology for the work of the FHTP is set out in the Annex to this document.
BEPS Action 6 – Prevention of Tax Treaty Abuse
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard
The minimum standard on treaty shopping included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 6 (OECD, 2015[5])
requires Inclusive Framework jurisdictions to include in their tax treaties an express language (generally in
the preamble) stating parties’ common intention to eliminate double taxation without enabling non-taxation
or reduced taxation through tax evasio n or avoidance (including through treaty shopping arrangements) ,
along with specific anti-abuse provisions implementing this common intention. Jurisdictions only need to
satisfy th ese requirements , if requested to do so by another jurisdiction member of th e Inclusive
Framework.
Since its launch in 2018, the BEPS Action 6  peer review process has revealed significant and steady
progress in Inclusive Framework members’ implementation of the BEPS Action 6 minimum standard. The
number of bilateral agreements concluded between members of the Inclusive Framework has increased
from only 13 agreements in 2018 to more than 1,600 today. Based on the latest comprehensive report,
more than 90% of the agreements concluded between Inclusive Framework members are either compliant
with the minimum standard or are on track to becoming compliant. This increase is due mostly to the entry
into effect of the provisions of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (BEPS MLI). To date, the BEPS MLI covers
105 jurisdictions (including 102 Inclusive Framework members) and around 2,000 bilateral tax treaties in
total.
As the implementation has reached a mature stage, the focus of BEPS Action 6 has shifted toward
providing targeted technical assistance to support jurisdictions, where needed, with the implementation of
the minimum standard. In parallel, assistance has been offered to encourage jurisdictions using the BEPS
MLI to complete the necessary steps to bring its provisions into effect.

RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens
In light of the recent changes to the peer review methodology for Action 6  agreed in 2024, the Inclusive
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further process improvements are required
at this stage.
Therefore, given the advanced state of implementation, BEPS Action 6 now focusses on providing targeted
technical assistance to all Inclusive Framework members to support the implementation of the minimum
standard. Following the 2023 comprehensive peer review, the frequency of these reviews is now reduced
to once every five years, with the next review schedul ed for 2 028, thereby easing  the associated
administrative burdens. Inclusive Framework members can request bespoke technical assistance at any
time, in particular in relation to the signature or ratification of the BEPS MLI, as well as for questions on
interpretation, implementation, or practical challenges encountered. The Inclusive Framework Secretariat
also proactively engages with jurisdictions to support effective implementation.
BEPS Action 13 – Country-by-Country Reporting
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard
The minimum standard on Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting included in the BEPS Final Report on
Action 13 (OECD, 2015[6]) requires MNE groups with consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR 750
million to file an annual  CbC report with the tax administration of the jurisdiction where the MNE group is
headquartered. This report is automatically exchanged under existing international agreements with those
jurisdictions where the MNE group has resident entities or permanent establishments, provided they have
implemented the necessary framework for CbC reporting.
CbC reporting offers tax administrations unprecedented insights into the global activities of MNE groups
operating within their jurisdiction providing key information such as profit before tax, income tax paid and
accrued, and the number of employees. Presented in a standardised format, this information improves
their understanding of the group’s business and supports the high-level assessment of transfer pricing and
other BEPS-related risks.
Since the launch of the peer review process  in 2017, implementation of the  BEPS Action 13 minimum
standard has reached a mature stage, with most Inclusive Framework members successfully ensuring that
CbC reports are filed and exchanged in line with the minimum standard.
Reflecting this maturity , the methodology was revised in 2020 to reduce the burden on jurisdictions with
stable frameworks by introducing a simplified peer review. In the current peer review (2024 -2025), this
applies to over half of all members. For the remaining members , the annual review remains valuable for
receiving feedback, addressing recommendations, and promptly identifying issues like delayed exchanges
or data quality concerns.
To date, 120 Inclusive Framework members have introduced a CbC reporting filing obligation  for ultimate
parent entities of MNE groups resident in their jurisdiction, covering virtually all MNE groups that meet the
filing threshold. Over 4,100 bilateral relationships have been established to facilitate the exchange of CbC
reports among almost 100 Inclusive Framework members. In total, 81 members are in a position to receive
CbC reports on fo reign-headed MNE groups, while others have made substantial progress in achieving
this position. Significant progress has been achieved in supporting the 75 developing countries in the
Inclusive Framework to gain access to CbC reports . However, continued e fforts are necessary to close
remaining gaps and ensure that all developing countries can fully benefit from BEPS Action 13.
