framework in practice (“Stage 1 Peer Review”). Stage 2 involves the review of the measures taken by the
assessed jurisdiction to address any shortcomings identified in its Stage 1 Peer Revi ew (“Stage 2 Peer
Monitoring”).
52. During the Stage 1 Peer Review and Stage 2 Peer Monitoring, inputs would be obtained from the
assessed jurisdictions as well as the assessed jurisdiction’s peers in line with the process followed in
Section II(A)(i) and II( A)(ii) respectively. However, inputs obtained from peers indicating that such
jurisdiction’s policy or practice concerning MAP requires improvement and accepted by the FTA MAP
Forum as described in paragraph 45 would lead to the FTA MAP Forum considering h ow to move the
assessed jurisdiction to a full  peer review process . Therefore, only other inputs would be considered as
part of the simplified peer review process.
53. There would be no formal mechanism for taxpayer input in the simplified peer review process .
Nevertheless, taxpayers that face difficulties in their interactions with one competent authority can always
approach the other competent authority concerned. The competent authority that is approached by a
taxpayer can also always include the input provided by the taxpayer in its peer input with respect to an
assessed jurisdiction where it considers this relevant, which would be taken into account in the peer review
process.12
54. The Stage 1 Peer Review process would follow the Drafting and Approval process described in
Section II(B) and the Adoption process described in Section II(C), including the timelines prescribed, as
well as the confidentiality obligations highlighted in Section II(E), except the following:
a. The Stage 1 Peer Review under the simplified peer review process would follow a simplified format
as contained in Annex 2.J. and would be focused on ensuring that the assessed jurisdiction can
set up a more robust MAP programme to handle and resolve future MAP cases  efficiently,
effectively and in a timely manner where needed.
b. It is clarified that references to the CFA are seen to mean the Inclusive Framework in connection
with the adoption of the reports prior to publication.
55. The Stage 2 Peer Monitoring process would commence two years after the date of approval of the
Stage 1 Peer Review report. The Stage 2 Peer Monitoring process would follow the process described in
Section II(D), including the timelines prescribed, and the confidentiality obligations highlighted in Section
II(E) except that it is clarified that references to the CFA is seen to mean the Inclusive Framework in
connection with the adoption of the reports prior to publication.
56. Following the approval of the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report , where any recommendations
connected to elements of the Terms of Reference  other than those connected to changing existing tax
treaties13  are remaining in a report, the assessed jurisdiction shall continue to provide update reports (as
discussed under Section II(D)) to the FTA MAP Forum once every three years starting from the date of the
approval of the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report by the Inclusive Framework. This update report would be
a detailed written report by the assessed jurisdiction on  (i) the steps it has taken or is taking to address
shortcomings identified in its peer review report; and (ii) any plans or changes to its legislative or procedural
framework relating to the implementation of the minimum standard. An assessed jurisdiction could also
include in the update report any other plans or changes to the implementation of its MAP regime since its
Stage 1 Peer Review report. The update report should be provided in English or French and in an electronic
format. Peers would be invited to provide inputs on the update report, as under paragraph 52.
57. If there are no recommendations  other than those connected to changing existing tax treaties
remaining in the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report  and where peers confirm or provide no additional input
with respect to an update report , there would be no further review of a n assessed jurisdiction until it is
found to meet one of the conditions for “meaningful MAP experience” described above.

58. In the event that the Action 14 minimum standard or Terms of Reference are revised in the future,
the simplified peer review process would be reviewed by the FTA MAP Forum to ensure that it aligns with
the revisions.
B. Full peer review process
59. For all remaining members of the Inclusive Framework i.e. members that do not qualify for the
“simplified peer review proces s” described above or wish to be subject to a full peer review (“ qualifying
jurisdictions”), a full peer review would be conducted in a continuing, concise and effective manner. The
full peer review process would commence from 2024 onwards.
60. The full peer r eview process would be conducted in cycles with each cycle constituting a three
year period during which all qualifying jurisdictions would be peer reviewed. Once each cycle of three years
of peer reviews is completed, a gap year would be provided to allow the FTA MAP Forum to focus on other
areas. Therefore, each qualifying jurisdiction would be subject to the full peer review process once every
four years, with around one-third of all qualifying jurisdictions being reviewed in the first, second and third
year respectively and the fourth year being a gap year.14
61. For the full peer review process, inputs would be obtained from the assessed jurisdictions as well
as the assessed jurisdiction’s peers in line with the process followed in Section II(A)(i) and II(A) (ii)
respectively.
62. There would  be no formal mechanism for taxpayer input in the full peer review process.
Nevertheless, taxpayers that face difficulties in their interactions with one competent authority can always
approach the other competent authority c oncerned. The competent authority that is approached by a
taxpayer can also always include the input provided by the taxpayer in its peer input with respect to an
assessed jurisdiction where it considers this relevant, which would be taken into account in the peer review
process.15
63. The full peer review process would follow the process described in Section II(D), including the
timelines prescribed, and the confidentiality obligations highlighted in Section II(E) except that:
a. Update reports would be submitted by each assessed jurisdiction based on deadlines connected
to the organisation of the full peer review cycles, to ensure that the peer reviews of all jurisdictions
are completed at the end of each cycle.
b. An assessed jurisdiction would, in its update report , identify the steps it has taken or is taking to
address any shortcomings identified in its previously published  peer review report and any plans
or changes to its legislative or procedural framework relating to the implementation of the minimum
standard. An assessed jurisdiction could also include in the report any other plans or changes to
the implementation of its MAP regime since its previously published peer review report.
c. The full peer review process would lead to the drafting, adoption and publicati on of fresh Peer
Monitoring Reports in each cycle, instead of Stage 2 Peer Monitoring reports that updated Stage 1
peer review reports under the Peer Review and Monitoring process under Section II.
d. It is clarified that references to the CFA are seen to mean the Inclusive Framework in connection
with the adoption of the reports prior to publication.
64. It is also acknowledged that a full peer review process may not be necessary going forward for
jurisdictions that are already fully in line with the Action 14  minimum standard, with no recommendations
remaining in their last published peer review report . Such jurisdictions are required to  provide update
reports as noted above with respect to the relevant full peer review cycle . However, subject to no input
showing policy/practices that require improvement being provided by peers with respect to the update
report, no full peer review report would be published for such jurisdictions in the concerned full peer review
cycle.
