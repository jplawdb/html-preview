“date of Milestone 1” and where the “end” date (as determined in paragraph 13 or 14 of this note) falls
within the reporting period.
The number of months taken for each case that has an applicable “date of Milestone 1” shall be computed
as the number of days taken from the “start” date to the date of Milestone 1 divided by 365 and multiply by
12 (rounded to two decimal places). The second step is to divide this aggregated number of months by the
total number of cases that have an applicable “date of Milestone 1” and where the “end” date for the case
falls within the reporting period. The result is the average time taken from the “start” of a MAP case to
Milestone 1 in months (rounded to two decimal places).
(d) Average time taken from Milestone 1 to “End” – see Column 5 of Table 1 and Table 2
and Column 4 of Table 3
The average time taken from Milestone 1 to the “end” of a MAP case shall be calculated by first aggregating
the number of months  from the date of Milestone 1 (as determined in paragraph 15 of this note) to the
“end” date (as determined in paragraph 13 or 14 of this note) for each case that has an applicable “date of
Milestone 1” and where the “end” date (as determined in paragraph 13 or 14 of this note) falls within the
reporting period.
The number of months taken for each case that has an applicable “date of Milestone 1” shall be computed
as the number of days taken from the date of Milestone 1 to the “end” date divided by 365 and multiply by
12 (rounded to two decimal places). The second step is to divide this aggregated number of months by the
total number of cases that have an applicable “date of Milestone 1” and where the “end” date for the case
falls within the reporting perio d. The result is the average time taken from Milestone 1 to the “end” of a
MAP case in months (rounded to two decimal places).
(e) Cases closed in the Unilateral stage – see Annex to Table 1 and Annex to Table 2
MAP cases that are resolved under the outcomes “denied MAP access ”, “objection is not justified ” and
“unilateral relief granted” as defined in paragraph 2(a) of Annex 3.D.
(f) Cases closed in the Bilateral stage – see Annex to Table 1 and Annex to Table 2
MAP cases that are resolved under the outcom es “withdrawn by taxpayer ”, “resolved via domestic
remedy”, “agreement fully eliminating double taxation eliminated / fully resolving taxation not in accordance
with tax treaty ”, “agreement partially eliminating double taxation / partially resolving taxati on not in
accordance with tax treaty ”, “agreement that there is no taxation not in accordance with tax treaty ”, “no
agreement including agreement to disagree ” and “any other outcome ”. as defined in paragraph 2(a) of
Annex 3.D.
(g) Average time taken from “Start” to “End” for Cases closed in the Unilateral stage and
Cases closed in the Bilateral stage – see Annex to Table 1 and Annex to Table 2
The average time calculated as under paragraph 3(a) of Annex 3.D for Cases closed in the Unilateral
Stage or Cases closed in the Bilateral Stage as under paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) respectively.

Introduction
1. The Report on Action 14: Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective (“the 2015 Action
14 Report”) (OECD, 2015[1]) was approved by the OECD Committee of Fiscal Affairs (“CFA”) in September,
presented to the OECD Council and endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers on 8 October 2015. This
Report contained a commitment by countries engaged in the work to the implementation  of a minimum
standard to ensure that they resolve treaty-related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner and
to have their compliance with the minimum standard reviewed by their peers – i.e. the other members of
the Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum (“the FTA MAP Forum”).
2. One of the elements of the minimum standard1 requires that jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance
should identify the specific information and documentation that a taxpayer is required to submit with a
request for MAP assistance and jurisdictions should not limit access to MAP based on the argument that
insufficient information was provided if the taxpayer has provided this information. The 2015 Action 14
Report (OECD, 2015[1]) tasked the FTA MAP Forum to develop guidance on the specific information and
documentation required to be submitted with a request for MAP assistance.
Guidance on the specific information and documentation required to be
submitted with a request for MAP assistance
3. The Action 14 minimum standard requires that jurisdictions should not deny access to MAP based
on the argument that insufficient information was provided. To provide certainty and clarity to taxpayers on
the information and documentation requirement, jurisdictions are to publish clear rules, guidelines and
procedures on access to and use of the MAP, including the specific information and documentation that
should be submitted in a taxpayer’s request for MAP assistance. As tasked by the 2015 Action 14 R eport
(OECD, 2015 [1]), the FTA MAP Forum has developed the following guidance on the information and
documentation required to be submitted with a request for MAP assistance.
4. To ensure that a taxpayer’s MAP request is received and will be reviewed by the competent
authority in a timely manner, a jurisdiction’s MAP guidance should clearly provide information on how a
taxpayer can make a request for MAP assistance and should include the following:
(i) Contact information of t he competent authority or the office in charge of MAP cases – to
ensure that MAP requests are received by the competent authority in a timely manner, jurisdictions
should provide information on the name and the designation of the person or the office to which
the MAP request should be submitted, including the specific mailing address or email address to
which a MAP request should be sent.
