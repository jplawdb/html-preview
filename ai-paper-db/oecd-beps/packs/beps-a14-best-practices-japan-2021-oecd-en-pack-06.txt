treaties yet in place.19 Three of these six treaties have already entered into force. All of these
treaties contain  a provision that is equivalent to Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax
Convention (OECD, 2017). The effects of these newly signed treaties have been reflected in
the analysis above where it has relevance.
Multilateral Instrument
58. Japan signed the Multilateral Instrument  and has deposited its instrument of
ratification on 26 September 2018. The Multilateral Instrument has entered into force for
Japan on 1 January 2019.
59. Article 17(2) of t hat instrument stipulates that Article 17(1) – containing the
equivalent of Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017) – will apply
in place of or in the absence of a provision in tax treaties that is equivalent to Article 9(2) of
the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017) . However, this shall only apply if both
contracting parties to the applicable tax treaty have listed this treaty as a covered tax
agreement under the Multilateral Instrument. Article 17(2) of the Multilateral Instrument
does not take effect for a tax treaty if one or both of the treaty partners have, pursuant to
Article 17(3), reserved the right not to apply Article 17(1) for those tax treaties that already
contain the equivalent of Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017),
or not to apply Article 17(1) in the absence of such equivalent under the condition that: (i) it
shall make appropriate corresponding adjustments or (ii) its competent authority shall
endeavour to resolve the case under mutual agreement procedure of the applicable tax treaty.
Where neither treaty partner has made such a reservation, Article 17(4) of the Multilateral
Instrument stipulates that both have to notify the depositary  whether the applicable treaty
already contains a provision equivalent to Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention
(OECD, 2017) . Where such a notification is made by both of them, the Multilateral
Instrument will modify this treaty to replace that provision. If neither or only one treaty
partner made this notification, Article 17(1) of the Multilateral Instrument will supersede this
treaty only to the extent that the provision contained in that treaty relating to the granting of
corresponding adjustments is incompatible with Article 17(1) (containing the equivalent of
Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017)).
60. Japan has not reserved, pursuant to Article 17(3), the right not to apply Article 17(1)
of the Multilateral Instrument for those tax treaties that already contain a provision equivalent
to Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017) . With regard to the 46
tax treaties identified in paragraph 56 above (disregarding th ose six treaties that do not
contain Article 9 at all ) that are considered not to contain this equivalent, Japan listed 36
treaties as a covered tax agreement under the Multilateral Instrument, but only for 25 of them
made a notification on the basis of Article 17(4) that they do contain a provision described in
Article 17(2).20
61. Of the relevant treaty 25 partners, all are signatories to the Multilateral Instrument
and have listed their treaty with Japan as a covered tax agreement under that instrument, but
11 have, on the basis of Article 17(3), reserved the right not to apply Article 17( 1) as they
considered that their treaty with Japan already contains the equivalent of Article 9(2). 12 of
the 14 remaining treaty partners also made a notification on the basis of Ar ticle 17(4). Of
19 One of these treaties is with a treaty partner, for which Japan currently continues to apply the 1986 treaty with the former
USSR, but which will no longer do so upon entry into force of this new treaty.
20 These 36 treaties include the treaty with former Czechoslovakia that Japan continues to apply to the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic.

these 12 treaty partners, nine have  already deposited their instrument of ratification of the
Multilateral Instrument, following which the Multilateral Instrument has entered into force
for the treaties between Japan and these treaty partne rs, and therefore has replaced the
relevant treaty provision to include the equivalent of Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax
Convention (OECD, 2017). For the remaining three treaties, the Multilateral Instrument will,
upon entry into force, replace the pro visions in these treaties to include the equivalent of
Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017) . For the remaining two
treaty partners that did not made a notification on the basis of Article 17(4), these treaty
partners have already deposited its instrument of ratification of the Multilateral Instrument.
Therefore, the Multilateral Instrument has entered into force for these treaties and  has
superseded the relevant treaty provision s to include the equivalent of Article 9(2) of the
OECD Mo del Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), but only to the extent that the provision
contained in these treaties  relating to the granting of corresponding adjustments are
incompatible with Article 17(1).
62. Furthermore, for the remaining 11 treaties for which Japan did not make a notification
on the basis of Article 17(4), all relevant treaty partners are signatories to the Multilateral
Instrument and listed their treaty with Japan as a covered tax agreement under that
instrument. Of the  partners to the 11  relevant treaties, two have, pursuant to Article 17(3),
reserved the right not to apply Article 17(1).21 Four of the remaining nine treaty partners have
already deposited their instruments of ratification of the Multilateral Instrument, following
which the Multilateral Instrument has entered into force for the treaties between Japan and
these treaty partners, and therefore has superseded the relevant treaty provision to include the
equivalent of Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), but only to
the extent that the provision contained in these treaties relating to the granting of
corresponding adjustments are incompatible with Article 17(1). The provision  in the
remaining five treaties will, upon the entry into force of the Multilateral Instrument for these
treaties, be superseded by the Multilateral Instrument to include the equivalent of Article 9(2)
of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), but only to the extent that the provision
contained in these treaties relating to the granting of cor responding adjustments are
incompatible with Article 17(1).
63. Peers did not provide input relating to this particular best practice.
21 With respect to the treaty with former Czechoslovakia, which Japan continues to apply to the Czech Republic and the Slovak
Republic, the Czech Republic is one of the treaty partners that made a reservation on the basis of Article 17(3) of the Multilateral
Instrument. The treaty is therefore included in these two treaties. The treaty with former Czechoslovakia will therefore not be
modified concerning the Czech Republic. However, as regards the Slovak Republic, since it has already deposited its instrument
of ratification of the Multilateral Instrument,  Article 17(1) of the Multilateral Instrument has superseded the relevant t reaty
provision to include the equivalent of Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2017), but only to the extent
that the provision contained in these treaties relating to the granting of corresponding adjustments are incompatible with Article
17(1).
