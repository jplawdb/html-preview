BEPS ACTION 14 ON MORE EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS – PEER REVIEW DOCUMENTS © OECD 2023
Introduction
1. The Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS Action Plan”) 1 published by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) in 2013 at the request of the G20
identified 15 actions to address BEPS in a comprehensive manner. Recognising that the actions to counter
BEPS must be complemented with actio ns that ensure certainty and predictability for businesses, one of
the BEPS actions, Action 14, calls for effective dispute resolution mechanisms:
ACTION 14
Make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective
Develop solutions to address obstacles that prevent countries from [re]solving treaty-related
disputes under MAP, including the absence of arbitration provisions in most treaties and the fact
that access to MAP and arbitration may be denied in certain cases.
2. In October 2015, the BEPS package compris ing an explanatory statement and 13 reports
addressing BEPS concerns identified in the BEPS Action Plan was approved by the OECD and endorsed
by the G20 Finance Ministers. 2 One of the reports , Report on Action 14: Making Dispute Resolution
Mechanisms More Effective (“the 2015 Action 14 Report”)  (OECD, 2015[1]), discusses the obstacles that
prevent countries from resolving treaty -related disputes under the mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”)
and recommended measures to overcome such obstacles.
3. Recognising the importance of removing double taxation as an obstacle to cross-border trade and
investment, the 2015 Action 14 Report  (OECD, 2015 [1]) also reflected the commitment of countries to
implement a minimum standard (“the Action 14 minimum standard”) to ensure that they resolve treaty -
related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner. The minimum standard is complemented by a
set of best practices. Furthermore, to ensure the ef fective implementation of the minimum standard,
countries also committed to have their compliance with the minimum standard reviewed by their peers –
i.e. the other members of the Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum (“FTA MAP Forum”). In addition,
a number of countries 3 also consider that mandatory binding arbitration is the best way of ensuring that
tax treaty disputes are effectively resolved through MAP and have committed to adopt and implement
mandatory binding arbitration as a way to resolve disputes  that otherwise prevent the resolution of cases
through the mutual agreement procedure.
4. In this regard, the 2015 Action 14 Report (OECD, 2015[1]) mandated that the Committee on Fiscal
Affairs (“CFA”) through its Workin g Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questions (“Working
1 Terms of Reference to monitor and review the implementing of
the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard to make dispute
resolution mechanisms more effective

Party 1”) and the FTA MAP Forum develop the Terms of Reference and the Assessment Methodology for
the monitoring of the implementation of the Action 14 minimum standard by all OECD and G20 co untries,
as well as jurisdictions that commit to the minimum standard (see mandate in Annex 1.A.).
The Action 14 minimum standard for the resolution of tax treaty-related disputes
5. Removing obstacles that double taxation presents is key to the development of economic relations
between jurisdictions. In this regard, jurisdictions enter into tax treaties with the aim of removing such
obstacles and to provide taxpayers with certainty on the tax treatment of their cross border trade,
investment and activities. Where doubts or difficulties arise in relation to the interpretation or application of
the tax treaty, or where taxpayers enter into disputes with tax authorities on the tax treaty treatment of their
activities, Article 25 4 of the OECD Model Tax Convention  on Income and on Capital (“OECD Model Tax
Convention”) (OECD, 2019[2]), provides a mechanism – the mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”), that
allows the resolution of such difficulties or disputes.
6. The MAP, which is ind ependent from the ordinary legal remedies available under domestic law,
allows the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties to resolve differences or difficulties regarding
the interpretation or application of the Convention on a mutually -agreed basis. This mechanism seeks to
ensure the proper application and interpretation of tax treaties so that taxpayers entitled to the benefits of
the treaty are not subject to taxation by either of the Contracting Parties which is not in accordance with
the terms of the treaty.
7. The Action 14 minimum standard aims to  strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the MAP
process. The minimum standard is constituted by specific measures that jurisdictions will take to ensure
that they resolve treaty -related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner and is complemented
by a set of best practices. The elements of the minimum standard set out in the 2015 Action 14 Report
(OECD, 2015[1]) seeks to achieve the following thr ee general objectives in order to ensure that dispute
resolution mechanisms are more effective:
 Jurisdictions should ensure that treaty obligations related to MAP are fully implemented in good
faith and that MAP cases are resolved in a timely manner;
 Jurisdictions should ensure that administrative processes promote the prevention and timely
resolution of treaty-related disputes; and
 Jurisdictions should ensure that taxpayers that meet the requirements of paragraph 1 of Article 25
of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2019[2]) can access the MAP.
8. In other words, for the MAP to be more effective it should: (i) allow the competent authorities to
reach agreements on how to prevent tax treaty -related disputes from arising i n the first instance, (ii) be
available and accessible to taxpayers where tax-treaty disputes do arise; and (iii) be effective in resolving
such disputes, including the timely implementation of the agreements that are reached by competent
authorities through the MAP process.
9. Jurisdictions should enhance their competent authority relationships and work collectively to
improve the effectiveness of the MAP by becoming members of the FTA MAP Forum and fully participate
in the work of the FTA MAP Forum. A jurisd iction’s compliance with the Action 14 minimum standard will
be reviewed by its peers in the context of the FTA MAP Forum. The Terms of Reference describe the
Action 14 minimum standard and break them down into 21 elements to reflect the four key areas of an
effective dispute resolution mechanism - preventing disputes, availability and access to MAP, resolution of
MAP cases and implementation of MAP agreements. These elements are complemented by 12 best
practices. The elements and best practices should be interpreted based on the 2015 Action 14 Report and
in accordance with the Commentary on Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019[2]).5
The best practices are not part of the minimum standard and whether or not a jurisdiction has implemented
