jurisdictions would spontaneously exchange information on taxpayers benefitting from this category (using
the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework).
In light of the annual monitoring results from the past years, and available data more generally, there
appear to be only a limited number of taxpayers benefitting from the third category of IP assets and
rebuttable presumption. In addition, BEPS-risks related to these categories appear limited and any future
regime offering such features could be subject to monitoring as part of the BEPS impact assessment under
the revised methodology.
Therefore, this category is monitored for the last time in 2025. The exchange of information requirements
will be retained. The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and, for transparency
purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
Potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes
The conclusion of “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” was taken by the FHTP if the  regime is in
scope, meets the low or no effective tax rate criterio n and implicates one or more of the criteria, but an
assessment of the economic effects shows that the regime is not having a harmful impact in practice. The
purpose of monitoring such regimes was that, where changes in the data were identified, the FHTP could
reconsider the conclusion.
The revised methodology for reviewing regimes will no longer include the conclusion of “potentially harmful
but not actually harmful”, because of its replacement by the BEPS impact assessment.
Therefore, this category is m onitored for the last time in 2025 . The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
Disadvantaged areas regimes
The purpose of the ongoing monitoring of disadvantaged areas regimes  is that if the FHTP finds an
indication of adverse economic effects from a regime, the FHTP would decide on a case -by-case basis
what additional data would be necessary to inform a decision as to whether the regime should be treated
as an IP regime and assessed against the nexus approach.
The Inclusive Framework already previously decided that, in general, these disadvantaged areas do not
pose a significant BEPS-risk. Further, the annual monitoring results from the past years suggest that it is
not expected that there will be a significant increase in the disadvantaged areas regimes that would justify
reopening conclusions in this respect. In addition, under th e revised methodology, the FHTP no longer
concludes any disadvantaged areas regimes.
Therefore, this category is monitored  for the last time in 2025.  The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be inc luded in the list of regimes for possible
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
Grandfathered non-IP regimes
Of all regimes reviewed by the FHTP since the start of the BEPS project, almost 200 have been abolished
or amended, with a large part foresee ing grandfathering in accordance with the FHTP’s timelines. The
FHTP’s timelines include a cut -off date (i.e. the date when the FHTP’s decision on regime is published)
and close-off date (i.e. the date that the regime is abolished or amended). New entrants to the regime after
the cut-off date and before the close -off date cannot benefit from grandfathering. Part of the legislative
review of the FHTP is whether these dates are included in the legislation for the regime.

Based on the annual monitoring results from the past years, it appears that for grandfathered regimes, the
results show that the number of taxpayers and amount of income in the regimes decreases or remains
stable throughout the grandfathering years. No regime has been reopened by the FHTP bec ause of the
monitoring results. This indicates that the legislative review done by the FHTP is sufficient and that the
added value of the monitoring is low.
Therefore, this category is monitored  for the last time in 2025. The regimes will remain on the FH TP’s
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
Reduced frequency of monitoring and peer review exercises
Monitoring substantial activities requirements for non-IP regimes
With the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]), the substantial activities requirements were elevated to
one of the key criteria of the FHTP’s review of preferential regimes. In 2017, the FHT P agreed guidance
on the substantial activities requirements non -IP regimes, which were set out in Annex D of the 2017
Progress Report (OECD, 2017[8]). The guidance also indicated the need for monitoring to ensure that  the
substantial activities requirements have been implemented effectively in practice.
The annual monitoring for substantial activities in non-IP regimes consists of two parts. The first part is “an
assessment of the jurisdiction’s transparent mechanism t o review taxpayer compliance and to deny
benefits if these core-income generating activities are not undertaken by the taxpayer or do not occur within
the jurisdiction”. This mechanism focusses on the enforcement of the legislation in practice (e.g. how
jurisdictions are ensuring compliance and jurisdictions’ responsiveness to risks of non -compliance). The
analysis intends to ensure that the regime is consistent with the substantial activities requirements that the
jurisdiction declared it had in place at the time the FHTP reviewed the regime as “not harmful”. The second
part of the monitoring is the collection of data regarding the number of taxpayers, the number of employees,
amount of expenditures, amount of income, and statistics regarding taxpayers that  did not qualify for the
benefits because they did not meet the substantial activities requirements.
The FHTP has analysed the annual monitoring results from the past years and concluded that most
jurisdictions have a transparent review mechanism in place . For any new regimes that are subject to
monitoring, the FHTP has to review these jurisdictions’ transparent review mechanism, however the
number of new regimes being introduced is decreasing. This implies that the focus of the FHTP has shifted
to the sec ond stage of the process, i.e. the review of the statistical data. The  Inclusive Framework
concluded that this is now an established process. To decrease the burden on the monitored jurisdictions
and the FHTP, the Inclusive Framework decided a lesser frequ ency in the review of the substantial
activities requirements in non -IP regimes. Instead of an annual monitoring, monitoring of these regimes
will take place on a three-yearly basis. The FHTP will still collect data in respect of each of the three years
for which the monitoring is carried out.
Outside of the three-year cycle, an intermediate review of a particular regime can occur at any moment in
time when a reviewed jurisdiction requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented swiftly.
Generally, if significant issues for a specific regime are identified  between two cycles, an intermediate
review of that regime can be initiated either at the request of an Inclusive Framework member or by the
Secretariat.
Monitoring substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions
In 2017, the FHTP presented its output of the work on the BEPS Action 5 mandate for considering revisions
or additions to FHTP framework. As part of this work, the FHTP agreed on the resumption of the application
of the substantial activities factor to no or only nominal tax jurisdictions. The FHTP identified the no or only
