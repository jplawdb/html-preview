15. To facilitate taxpayers’ access to MAP, jurisdictions should ensure transparency relating to their
MAP regimes – information on how to access MAP must be available, clear and easily accessible to the
public. In this regard, the Action 14 minimum standard requires that:
B.8. Jurisdictions should publish clear rules, guidelines and procedures on access to and use of
the MAP and include the specific information and documentation that should be submitted in
a taxpayer’s request for MAP assistance.
B.9. Jurisdictions should take appropriate measures to make rules, guidelines and procedures on
access to and use of the MAP available and easily accessible to the public and should publish
their jurisdiction MAP profiles on a shared public platform pursuant to the agreed template.
B.10. Jurisdictions should clarify in their MAP guidance that audit settlements between tax
authorities and taxpayers do not preclude access to MAP. If jurisdictions have an
administrative or statutory dispute settlement/resolution proc ess independent from the audit
and examination functions and that can only be accessed through a request by the taxpayer,
and jurisdictions limit access to the MAP with respect to the matters resolved through that
process, jurisdictions should notify their  treaty partners of such administrative or statutory
processes and should expressly address the effects of those processes with respect to the
MAP in their public guidance on such processes and in their public MAP programme
guidance.14
Best practices
B.P.5. Jurisdictions should implement appropriate administrative measures to facilitate recourse to
the MAP to resolve treaty-related disputes, recognising the general principle that the choice
of remedies should remain with the taxpayer.
B.P.6. Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide that taxpayers will be allowed access
to the MAP so that the competent authorities may resolve through consultation the double
taxation that can arise in the case of bona fide taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments.15
B.P.7. Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on multilateral MAPs.
B.P.8. Jurisdictions should take appropriate measures to provide for a suspension of collections
procedures during the period a MAP case is pending. Such a suspension of collections
should be available, at a minimum, under the same conditions as apply to a person pursuing
a domestic administrative or judicial remedy.
C. Resolution of MAP cases – Elements of the minimum standard
16. An effective dispute resolution mechanism  must be capable of resolving disputes in a timely and
principled manner. The legal authority for competent authorities to come together to discuss a MAP case
with a view to resolving the case to avoid taxation which is not in accordance with the tax treat y may be
derived from paragraph 2 of Article 25. The Action 14 minimum standard requires that:
C.1. Jurisdictions should ensure that their tax treaties contain a provision which requires that the
competent authority who receives a MAP request from the taxp ayer, shall endeavour, if the
objection from the taxpayer appears to be justified and the competent authority is not itself
able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the MAP case by mutual agreement with
the competent authority of the other Contracting Party, with a view to the avoidance of taxation
which is not in accordance with the tax treaty.16

C.2. Jurisdictions should seek to resolve MAP cases 17 within an average time frame of 24
months.18 This time frame applies to both jurisdictions (i.e. the jurisdiction which receives the
MAP request from the taxpayer and its treaty partner).19
C.3. Jurisdictions should ensure that adequate resources are provided to the MAP function.
C.4. Jurisdictions should ensure that the staff in charge of MAP processes  have the authority to
resolve MAP cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable tax treaty, in particular
without being dependent on the approval or the direction of the tax administration personnel
who made the adjustments at issue or being influe nced by considerations of the policy that
the jurisdictions would like to see reflected in future amendments to the treaty.
C.5. Jurisdictions should not use performance indicators for their competent authority functions
and staff in charge of MAP processes based on the amount of sustained audit adjustments or
maintaining tax revenue.
C.6. Jurisdictions should provide transparency with respect to their positions on MAP arbitration.20
Best practices
B.P.9. Jurisdictions should implement appropriate procedures to permit, in certain cases and after
an initial tax assessment, requests made by taxpayer which are within the time period
provided for in the tax treaty for the multi-year resolution through the MAP of recurring issues
with respect to filed tax years, w here the relevant facts and circumstances are the same
and subject to the verification of such facts and circumstances on audit.
B.P.10. Jurisdictions should publish an explanation of the relationship between the MAP and
domestic law administrative and judicial remedies.21
B.P.11. Jurisdictions’ published MAP guidance should provide guidance on the consideration of
interest and penalties in the mutual agreement procedure.
B.P.12. Jurisdictions should include paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention in
their tax treaties.
D. Implementation of MAP agreements – Elements of the minimum standard
17. Any competent authority agreement reached on a MAP case by itself would not provide any relief
to the taxpayer unless the agreement is implemented. Th e second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 25
of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019 [2]) requires that the agreement reached shall be
implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the jurisdictions. The Action 14
minimum standard requires that:
D.1. Jurisdictions should implement any agreement reached in MAP discussions, including by
making appropriate adjustments to the tax assessed in transfer pricing cases.
D.2. Agreements reached by competent authorities through the MAP process should be
implemented on a timely basis.
D.3. Jurisdictions should either (i) provide in the ir tax treaties that any mutual agreement reached
through MAP shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in their domestic law22, or
(ii) be willing to accept alternative treaty provisions that limit the time during which a
Contracting Party may make an adjustment pursuant to Article 9(1) or Article 7(2), in order to
avoid late adjustments with respect to which MAP relief will not be available. 23
