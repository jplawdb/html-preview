33. Where there are no comments from the peers of the assessed jurisdiction, the draft Stage 2 Peer
Monitoring report will be sent to the assessed jurisdiction within 8 weeks of receipt of the updates provided
by the assessed jurisdiction to members of the FTA MAP Forum. The assessed jurisdiction should provide
any written comments on the draft report within 6 weeks of receipt, including confirmation of whether it
agrees with its draft Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report. The draft Stage 2 Peer Monitoring reports of the
jurisdictions will be circulated to FTA MAP Forum at least 6 weeks prior to the Forum meeting, for approval
under the written procedure following the same approval procedure as descri bed in paragraphs 22 to 24
of this note.
34. Following the approval of the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring reports by the FTA MAP Forum, the
Secretariat shall circulate to the FTA MAP Forum a report comprising three sections (“ the FTA MAP
Forum Update Report”) as follows:
 Section I which sets out the purpose and background to the monitoring and peer review process;
 Section II which provides an executive summary on the main conclusions based on the Stage 2
Peer Monitoring reports on assessed jurisdictions as approved; and
 Section III  which contains the individual Stage 2 Peer Monitoring reports on the assessed
jurisdictions as approved.
Any comments on the FTA MAP Forum Update Report should be limited to Section I and II of the report
given that the individual Stage 2 Peer Monitoring reports in Section III were already approved by the FTA
MAP Forum.
Adoption of FTA MAP Forum Update Report on Stage 2 Peer Monitoring Reports by the
CFA for publication
35. Following the approval of the FTA MAP Forum Update Report by the FTA  MAP Forum, it will  be
sent to the CFA within 1 week. In the exceptional circumstances that the FTA MAP Forum was unable to
approve the Stage 2 Peer Monitoring report on an assessed jurisdiction, this will be highlighted to the CFA
together with an explanation on why the FTA MAP Forum was unable to approve the report.
36. The CFA will be invited to adopt the FTA MAP Forum Update Report for publication following the
same approval procedure as described in paragraph 27  of this note. Following the adoption of the FTA
MAP Forum Update Report by the CFA, it shall be published as soon as possible.
E. Confidentiality
37. It is important for members of the FTA MAP Forum and the CFA to recognise that no part of any
report should be made publicly available in any form or manner prior to its publication. In addition, members
of the FTA MAP Forum should treat all documents produced in the course of the review of any jurisdiction
(e.g. documents describing a jurisdiction’s MAP regime, responses to the questionnaire, MAP stati stics
and draft reports) as confidential and should not make them  publicly available, unless approval of their
release has been obtained from the CFA. Strict respect for the confidentiality of th is work is essential to
the credibility of the monitoring and peer review process. Any breach of confidentiality shall be brought to
the attention of the FTA MAP Forum and the CFA for their decision on the most appropriate action to take.
Continued Monitoring Process from 2023 onwards
38. A review of the Assessment Methodology contained in this note in 2020 was foreseen at the time
of development of this Assessment Methodology, as noted in paragraph 5 . The purpose of this review is
to update the methodology in light of the experience in conducting peer monitoring, keepin g in mind the
need for an Assessment Methodology which effectively improves the shortcomings identified in the peer

review reports with the aim of ensuring an  effective MAP regime to benefit both governments and
taxpayers. The below methodology reflects the agreement of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on
BEPS (the “Inclusive Framework”) on how monitoring of the Action 14 minimum standard should continue
from 2023 onwards (“Continued Monitoring Process”), following the successful completion of the Peer
Review and Monitoring process as described in Section II in 2022. As this section is intended to
exhaustively cover the Continued Monitoring Process, unless explicitly referred to, it is clarified that
paragraphs 1 to 34 woul d not be of relevance to this process.
39. All Inclusive Framework member jurisdictions will work collectively to improve the effectiveness of
the MAP . To assist members in improving the effectiveness of their MAP regime, every member’s
compliance with the min imum standard will be reviewed by other members in the FTA MAP Forum, in
accordance with an assessment schedule to be developed by the FTA MAP Forum.
40. As noted in paragraph 7 of this note, the  Assessment Methodology applicable to the concluded
Peer Review and Monitoring process under Section II allowed the deferral of peer review of a jurisdiction
if it: (i) is a developing country (ii) is not an OECD/G20 country (iii) has not yet encountered a meaningful
level of MAP requests and (iv) has not received feedb ack from other members of the FTA MAP Forum
indicating that its MAP regime requires improvement. Accordingly, the peer reviews of 59 members of the
Inclusive Framework were deferred under that process.
41. However, the deferral of peer reviews is not provided for under the Continued Monitoring Process.
Therefore, all Inclusive Framework member jurisdictions (whether previously peer reviewed or otherwise)
shall be subject to monitoring under this process. Nevertheless, a simplified peer review process is put in
place for jurisdictions that are considered not to have “meaningful MAP experience” 9 and that do not wish
to undergo the full peer review process.
42. A jurisdiction would be considered to have “meaningful MAP experience” on the basis of the
following conditions:
a. a threshold of ten MAP cases in its MAP end inventory as reported in its MAP Statistics over the
three previous years on average is met by the jurisdiction, as detailed in paragraph 44; or
b. feedback is received from other members of the FTA MAP Forum in dicating that the jurisdiction’s
policy or practice concerning MAP requires improvement, as detailed in paragraph 45.
43. Accordingly, a full peer review process would be limited to jurisdictions that wish to be subject to
this process or have “meaningful MA P experience” based on these conditions. All remaining jurisdictions
would be subject to a simplified peer review process. Jurisdictions that become eligible for the full peer
review process based on the conditions for “meaningful MAP experience” defined a bove will remain
ineligible for the simplified peer review process in all subsequent years.
44. The first condition (see (a) above) for the “meaningful MAP experience” threshold is based on a
jurisdiction’s MAP caseload  as reported in its annual MAP Statistics . The threshold of ten MAP cases in
the end inventory over the previous three years on average ensures that only jurisdictions having
meaningful practical experience with MAP would be subject to the full peer review. This average would be
calculated by using the arithmetic mean of the number of all MAP cases10 remaining in the MAP inventory
on 31 December [Year 11], on 31 December [Year -1] and 31 December [Year -2], without the rounding of
decimal points upwards and thus , only averages of ten or above would be considered to meet this
condition.
45. The second condition  (see (b) above)  for the “meaningful MAP experience” trigger  is based on
peer input. Where peers provide input to the FTA MAP Forum noting that a jurisdiction’s policy or practice
with respect to MAP requires further improvement, such input would be discussed and considered by the
FTA MAP Forum, which would then decide whether the jurisdiction should be subject to the full peer review
process. The peer input que stionnaire developed for input in the Peer Review and Monitoring process
