Notes on Part (I) of Annex 3.B. (see also Annex 3.D. - Definition of terms and
rules for counting MAP cases)
(v)  Column 1 of Table 1 and Table 2: Treaty Partner
For each table (i.e. Table 1 for Attribution / Allocation MAP c ases and Table 2 for Other MAP
cases), separate reporting of MAP cases with a treaty partner is required only if:
(a) the number of post -2015 cases in your MAP inventory on 1 January of the year
(see e.g. Row 1, Column 2) plus the number of post-2015 cases started during the
reporting period (see e.g. Row 1, Column 3) with that treaty partner is at least five;
and
(b) that treaty partner is also reporting MAP Statistics for the reporting period in
accordance with this framework.
If such a number is less than five , the MAP statistic relating to that treaty partner shall be
aggregated and be reported under the category “Treaty Partners (de minimis rule applies)” (see
Row 2), together with other treaty partners that are also reporting MAP Statistics in accordance
with this framework and where the number of MAP cases with each of them is also less than
five.
For MAP Statistics relating to all other treaty partners (i.e. those not reporting MAP Statistics for
the reporting period in accordance with this framework), the MAP statistic relating to those treaty
partners shall be aggregated and be reported together under the category “Treaty Partners
(Others)” (see Row 3).
(vi) Column 2 of Table 1 and Table 2: Number of post-2015 cases in MAP inventory
on 1 January [Year]
Enter in this column the number of post -2015 cases (i.e. MAP cases that are received by a
competent authority from the taxpayer on or after 1 January 2016) in your MAP inventory that
are pending resolution as of 1 January of the year.
Note that for the first reporting period, i.e. 2016 reporting period, the number of post-2015 cases
in your MAP inventory should be reflected as “0” since all MAP cases that are received by a
competent authority from the taxpayer prior to 1 January 2016 should be reported in Annex
3.A. of this note.
(vii) Column 3 of Table 1 and Table 2: Number of post-2015 cases started during the
reporting period
Enter in this column the number of post -2015 cases started during the reporting period (i.e.
where the start date of the case falls within the reporting period).
(viii) Columns 4 to 13 of Table 1 and Table 2: Number of post-2015 cases closed
during the reporting period with an outcome as described in Columns 4 to 13
Enter in each of these columns the number of post -2015 cases closed in the reporting period
based on the outcome of each case as stated in the heading of each of these columns .
Note that these cases should not include pre -2016 cases which are closed in the reporting
period as such cases should be reported in Annex 3.A. of this note.

(ix) Column 14 of Table 1 and Table 2: Number of post-2015 cases remaining in
MAP inventory on 31 December [Year]
Enter in this column the number of post -2015 cases in your MAP inventory that are pending
resolution as of 31 December of the year.
The number of post -2015 cases remaining in the MAP inventory on 31 December of the year
should reflect:
 the number of post -2015 cases in MAP inventory on 1 January of the reporting period
(Column 2);
 plus the number of post-2015 cases started during the reporting period (Column 3);
 minus the number of post-2015 cases that are closed during the reporting period with
outcome as stated in Columns 4 to 13.
(x) Row 1 of Table 3: Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on
31 December [Year] falling under the age category “<2 years old”
In Column 2 to Row 1, the number of post-2015 cases in your MAP inventory that are pending
resolution as of 31 December of the [Year] , which were initiated on or after 1 January [Year -2]
based on the “Start Date”, would be published.
(xi) Row 2 of Table 3: Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on
31 December [Year] falling under the age category “>=2 and <4 years old”
In Column 2 to Row 2 the number of post-2015 cases in your MAP inventory that are pending
resolution as of 31 December of the [Year], which were initiated on or after 1 January [Year-4],
but before 31 December [Year-3] based on the “Start Date”, would be published.
(xii) Row 3 of Table 3: Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on
31 December [Year] falling under the age category “>=4 and <6 years old”
In Column 2 to Row 3 the number of post-2015 cases in your MAP inv entory that are pending
resolution as of 31 December of the [Year], which were initiated on or after 1 January [Year-6],
but before 31 December [Year-5] based on the “Start Date”, would be published.
(xiii) Row 4 of Table 3: Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on
31 December [Year] falling under the age category “>=6 years old”
In Column 2 to Row 4 the number of post-2015 cases in your MAP inventory that are pending

3 Please note that this data has not been matched with the concerned treaty partners. In addition, please note that delays in individual MAP cases may be owing to several reasons,
many of them being out of the concerned competent authority’s control, and thus, the time taken in the unilateral and bilateral stages should not be seen in isolation of the overall
average time and inventory management.
