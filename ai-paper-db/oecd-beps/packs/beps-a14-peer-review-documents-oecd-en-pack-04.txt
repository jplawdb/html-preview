Output of the Peer Review and Monitoring process
18. In accordance with the 2015 Action 14 Report  (OECD, 2015 [1]), the core output of the peer
monitoring process will come in the form of a report. The report will identify and describe the strengths and
any shortcomings that exist and provide recommendations as to how the shortcomings might be addressed
by the assessed jurisdiction.
19. Given the importance of the MAP for taxpayers seeking to ensure that their taxation is in
accordance with tax treaties, the report of an assessed jurisdiction should contain information on the MAP
regime of the assessed jurisdiction to assist taxpayers’ compliance with the requirements to access and
the use of MAP. Such information will also facilitate a jurisdiction in its request to commence discussion of
the MAP case with its treaty partner by ensuring that all the administrative and procedural requirements of
its treaty partner have been met.
20. The FTA MAP Forum will produce on a regular basis reports on the outcome of the reviews
conducted (“the FTA MAP Forum Report”) on its members’ compliance wi th the minimum standard and
measures taken by its members to improve their MAP regime. This FTA MAP Forum Report which will be
published on a shared public platform will include the purpose and background of this work conducted by
the FTA MAP Forum, an exe cutive summary on the outcome of the reviews conducted and will comprise
the individual reports of the assessed jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction’s report will include a description of its
legal and administrative framework for the MAP and the practical application of the framework. This will be
presented under 4 headings:
(i) Preventing disputes
(ii) Availability and access to MAP
(iii) Resolution of MAP cases
(iv) Implementation of MAP agreements.
21. The individual report of an assessed jurisdiction shall note all efforts made by the assessed
jurisdiction to implement the minimum standard including the plans shared by the assessed jurisdiction to
make legislative or procedural changes to implement the minimum standard taking into consideration that
the assessed jurisdiction migh t not have fully implemented elements of the minimum standard given the
time from its adoption to the time of its review. To assist the assessed jurisdiction in fully implementing the
minimum standard, the individual report of an assessed jurisdiction will thus also identify and describe any
shortcomings that exist in relation to the implementation of each of the elements of the minimum standard
and provide recommendations as to how these shortcomings might be addressed. Recommendations
should be specific and provide guidance to the jurisdiction as to what is expected.

4 The Report on Action 14 contains changes to Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its  Commentary.
Other changes to the Commentary will be included in the next update of the OECD Model  Tax Convention to reflect
the conclusions of the Report on Action 14. In this regard, all references to Article  25 and its Commentary shall be
read in the context of Article 25 and its Commentary as amended by the Report on Action 14 and the changes which
will be made to the Commentary in the next update of the OECD Model Tax Convention.
5 The reference to commentaries on Article 25 should be understood as those referred to in the 2015 Action 14 Report.
6 See paragraph 3 of Article 25 and its Commentary.
7 An APA is “an arrangement that determines, in advance of controlled transactions, an appropriate set of criteria (e.g.
method, comparables and appropriate adjustments thereto, critical assumptions as to future events) for the
determination of the transfer pricing for those transactions over a fixed period of time.” (see definition of APA in the
OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations  (“Transfer Pricing
Guidelines”)). A request for an APA is not a MAP case for purposes of the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework and
element C.2.
8 Situations may arise in which the issues resolved through an APA are relevant with respect to previous filed tax years
not included within the original scope of the APA. The concept of “roll -back” is further elaborated in paragraph 4.136
of Section F (Advance pricing arrangement) of Chapter IV of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines and in paragraph 69 of
Section D.4.2 (Possible retrospective application (“Roll back”)) of the Annex to Chapter IV (Guidelines for Conducting
Advance Pricing Arrangements under the Mutual Agreement Procedure (“MAP APAs”)) of the Transfer Pricing
Guidelines. Simply put, the “roll -back” of the APA is understood to mean th at the outcome of the APA is applied to
previous filed tax years not included within the original scope of the APA. A request for the roll -back of an APA is not
a MAP case for purposes of the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework and element C.2.

12 The relevant commitment under 2.6 of the Action 14 minimum standard deals only with access t o MAP, which,
consistently with what has been explained in paragraph 16 of the Report on Action 14 regarding the element 1.2, is
distinct from any obligation to endeavour to resolve the case pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 25 and from any
obligation to submit an issue to arbitration that may arise under treaties that contain an arbitration provision, whether
mandatory or not. Elements B.5 and B.10 of the Terms of Reference should therefore not be interpreted as including
any implicit commitment with respect to these other obligations.
13 See second sentence of paragraph 3 of Article 25 and its Commentary.
