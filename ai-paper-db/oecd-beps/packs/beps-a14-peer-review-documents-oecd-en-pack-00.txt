Introduction
The Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS Action Plan”)1 identified 15 actions to address
BEPS in a comprehensive manner. Recognising that the actions to counter BEPS must be complemented
with actions that ensure certainty for taxpayers, Action 14 calls for effective dispute resolution mechanisms.
In October 2015, the G20 Finance Ministers endorsed the BEPS package 2 which includes the report on
Action 14: Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective3 (“the 2015 Action 14 Report”) (OECD,
2015[1]). This report contains a commitment by countries to implement a minimum standard to ensure that
they resolve treaty-related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner. All members of the Inclusive
Framework on BEPS4 (“Members”) commit to the implementation of the Action 14 minimum standard and
to have their implementation reviewed pursuant to the Terms of Reference and Assessment Methodology
agreed by Members.
This compilation contains four documents, namely (i) the Terms of Reference; (ii) the Assessment
Methodology; (iii) the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) Statistics Reporting Framework; and (iv) the
Guidance on Specific Information and Documentation Required to be Submitted with a Request for MAP
Assistance.
The Terms of Reference translates the Action 14 minimum st andard into 21 elements. These elements
are complemented by 12 best practices. The best practices are not part of the minimum standard and thus
will not affect the assessment of Members. The Terms of Reference assess a Member’s legal and
administrative framework, including the practical implementation of this framework to determine how its
MAP regime performs relative to the 21 elements in the following four key areas – (A) preventing disputes;
(B) availability and access to MAP; (C) resolution of MAP cases ; and (D) implementation of MAP
agreements.
The Assessment Methodology establishes detailed procedures and guidelines for the Action 14 Peer
Review and Monitoring process. The initial peer review process involves two stages. Stage 1 involves the
review of a Member’s implementation of the minimum standard based on its legal framework for MAP and
the application of this framework in  practice. Stage 2 involves the review of the measures taken by the
Member to address any shortcomings identified in its Stage 1 Peer Review. Following these reviews, all
Members would be subject to continued monitoring: jurisdictions that have “meaningful MAP experience”
would undergo a full peer review process from 2024 once every four years and those that do not would
undergo a two-stage simplified peer review process from 2023.
The commitment by Members to implement the Action 14 minimum standard includes a commitment to
provide timely and complete reporting of MAP statistics pursuant to an agreed reporting framework. The
MAP Statistics Reporting Framework reflects a collaborative approach for the resolution of MAP cases
through the adoption of common timeline for both competent authorities to resolve MAP cases. With effect
from reporting period 2016, Members will report MAP stati stics based on common definitions of terms,
common rules on counting of MAP cases; and common reporting of MAP outcomes based on different
categories of outcomes.

The Action 14 minimum standard also requires Members to publish MAP guidance that identify the specific
information and documentation that a taxpayer is required to submit with a request for MAP assistance.
Members should not limit access to MAP based on the argument that insufficient information was provided
if the taxpayer has provided the required information. The Guidance on Specific Information and
Documentation Required to be Submitted with a Request for MAP Assistance  could be used by
Members in draw ing up their own MAP guidance and could also provide guidance to taxpayers in their
preparation of a MAP submission.
