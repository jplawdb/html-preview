Annex 2.D. Outline of Stage 1 Peer Review report
This annex provides a draft outline for the Stage 1 Peer Review reports for approval by the FTA MAP
Forum and subsequently for adoption by the CFA for publication. Drafts reports should as much as possible
follow a similar presentation and have a similar length and level of details, even though each report will be
tailored to the individual jurisdiction being assessed.
Executive Summary (1-2 pages)
The executive summary should:
(i) state the purpose of the report, i.e. (a) the report summarises the jurisdiction’s legal and
regularly framework for resolving tax treaty related disputes as well as the practical
implementation of that framework; (b) examines the jurisdiction’s framework against the
minimum standard set out in the Te rms of Reference to identify areas of improvement
so that the jurisdiction can improve its MAP regime with the objective of resolving tax
treaty-related disputes in a timely, effective and efficient manner;
(ii) summarise the mechanisms available in the jurisdiction to resolve tax treaty -related
disputes (e.g. number of tax treaties, arbitration provisions in tax treaties, EU arbitration
convention);
(iii)  summarise the outcome of the reviews of the jurisdiction’s compliance with the
minimum standard in each of the following areas – preventing disputes; availability and
access to MAP; resolution of MAP cases; and implementation of MAP agreements.
(iv) describe the follow up actions required from the assessed jurisdiction.
Introduction (2-3 pages)
This section should provide:
(i) the basis for the review, including the methodology used for the review and the
information that is used to conduct the review (e.g. response from questionnaire , peer
inputs, responses to peer and  taxpayers’ inputs, informatio n available in the
jurisdiction’s MAP profile, MAP statistics from reporting template, information published
by the jurisdiction);
(ii) further information on the mechanisms available in the jurisdiction to resolve tax treaty-
related disputes (e.g. network of t ax treaties, arbitration provisions in specific tax
treaties, EU arbitration convention);
(iii)  recent developments relating to dispute resolution mechanism (e.g. number of tax
treaties updated to incorporate elements of the minimum standard, number  of tax
treaties under negotiation, signatory of the multilateral instrument with specific
reference to the provisions relating to Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure),
administrative measures taken to improve dispute resolution mechanism).

Compliance with the minimum standard (15-20 pages)
This section comprises four sub-sections – (A) Preventing Disputes; (B) Availability and Access to MAP;
(C) Resolution of MAP Cases; and (D) Implementation of MAP Agreements. Each of the sub -sections
will be divided into elements of the minimum standard as described in the Terms of Reference.
The report shall note all efforts made by the assessed jurisdiction to implement the minimum standard
including the plans shared by the assessed jurisdiction to make legislative or procedural changes to
implement the minimum standard taking into consideration that the assessed jurisdiction might not have
fully implemented elements of the minimum standard given the time from its adoption to the time of its
review. For each of the element of the minimum standard, the report should also note the inputs from
peers and the assessed jurisdiction’s response to all relevant inputs received, if any.
An analysis of the jurisdiction’s compliance with each element of the minimum standard should be made.
Any shortcomings that exist in relation to the implementation of the element of the minimum standard
should be identified in the report and recommendations as to how these shortcomings might be
addressed should also be made in the report.  For each of the element, a summary shall be made as
follows:
Areas for Improvement Recommendations
