This includes cases where such an outcome is arrived at following the submission of the case
to arbitration in instances where the tax treaty contains an arbitration provision.
(viii) Agreement that there is no taxation not in accordance with the tax treaty (Column 11):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreement that there is no taxation not in
accordance with the tax treaty if the date of notification from the compete nt authority to the
taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an agreement reached via competent authority
discussion (regardless of whether the taxpayer accepts that outcome) (see paragraphs 13 and
14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. This includes cases where such an outcome is
arrived at following the submission of the case to arbitration in instances where the tax treaty
contains an arbitration provision.
(ix) No agreement including agreement to disagree (Column 12):
A MAP case shall be counted  as a case closed with no agreement if the date of notification
from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an outcome (see
paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. “No agreement” includes
agreement to disagree.
(x) Any other outcome (Column 13):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with any other outcome (not falling within any
of the outcomes described above) if the date of notification from the competent authority to the
taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an outcome (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note)
falls within the reporting period.
For purposes of this statistics reporting framework, if there are more than one outcomes relating to a MAP
request (for example, part of the MAP re quest is denied MAP access, part of the MAP request is granted
unilateral relief and part of the MAP request is resolved with the outcome that double taxation is fully
eliminated), the MAP case shall be considered closed based on the date of notification ( if there is more
than one notification, the date of the last notification) from the competent authority and the outcome
communicated in that notification to the taxpayer.
(b) Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31 December [YEAR] –
see Column 14 of Table 1 and Table 2
The number of post-2015 cases remaining in the MAP inventory on 31 December of the year is the number
of post-2015 cases in a competent authority’s inventory that are pending resolution as of 31 December of
that year.
(c) Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31 December [Year]
falling under the age category “<2 years old” – see Column 2/Row 1 of Table 3
The number of post -2015 cases in the MAP inventory that are pending resolution as of 31 December of
the [Year] that were initiated, based on the “Start Date”, on or after 1 January [Year -2].
(d) Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31 December [Year]
falling under the age category “>=2 and <4 years old” – see Column 2/Row 2 of Table 3
The number of post -2015 cases in the MAP inventory that are pending resolution as of 31 December of
the [Year] that were initiated, based on the “Start Date”, on or after 1 January [Year -4], but before 31
December [Year-3].

the [Year] that were in itiated, based on the “Start Date”, on or after 1 January [Year -6], but before 31
December [Year-5].
(f) Number of post-2015 cases remaining in MAP inventory on 31 December [Year] falling
under the age category “>=6 years old” – see Column 2/Row 4 of Table 3
The number of post -2015 cases in the MAP inventory that are pending resolution as of 31 December of
the [Year] that were initiated, based on the “Start Date”, on or before 31 December [Year -7].
3. Jurisdictions shall apply the following definitions and counting methods for purposes of their MAP
Statistics reporting as required under Part (II) of Annex 3.B. of this note:
(a) Average time take from “Start” to “End” of MAP case – see Column 2 of Table 1 and
Table  2 and Column 1 of Table 3
The average time taken from “start” to “end” of MAP case shall be calculated by first aggregating the
number of months from the “start” date (as determined in paragraph 10 or 11 of this note) to the “end” date
(as determined in paragraph 12 or 13 of this n ote) for each case where the “end” date for the case falls
within the reporting period.
The number of months taken for each case shall be computed as the number of days taken from the “start”
date to the “end” date divided by 365 and multiply by 12 (rounded to two decimal places). The second step
is to divide this aggregated number of months by the total number of cases where the “end” date for the
case falls within the reporting period. The result is the average time taken from the “start” to the “end” of a
MAP case in months (rounded to two decimal places).
(b) Average time taken from receipt of taxpayer’s MAP request to “Start” – see Column 3
of Table 1 and Table 2 and Column 2 of Table 3
The average time taken from the receipt of a taxpayer’s MAP su bmission to the “start” of MAP case (as
determined in paragraph 10 or 11 of this note) shall be calculated by first aggregating the number of months
from the date the taxpayer’s MAP submission is received by the competent authority (as referred to in
paragraph 10 of this note) to the “start” date for each case where the “end date” (as determined in
paragraph 13 or 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period.
The number of months taken for each case shall be computed as the number of days taken from t he date
of receipt of the taxpayer’s MAP submission to the “start” date divided by 365 and multiply by 12 (rounded
to two decimal places). The second step is to divide this aggregated number of months by the total number
of all cases where the “end” date f or the case falls within the reporting period. The result is the average
time taken from a taxpayer’s MAP submission to the “start” of MAP case in months (rounded to two decimal
places).
(c) Average time taken from “Start” to Milestone 1 – see Column 4 of Table 1 and Table 2
and Column 3 of Table 3
The average time taken from “start” of a MAP case to Milestone 1 shall be calculated by first aggregating
the number of months it took from the “start” date (as determined in paragraph 11 or 12 of this note) to the
“date of Milestone 1” (as determined in p aragraph 15 of this note) for each case that has an applicable
