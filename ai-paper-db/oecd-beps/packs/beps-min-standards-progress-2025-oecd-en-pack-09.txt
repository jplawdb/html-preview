• Example 3: Jurisdiction D joins the Inclusive Framework. The Secretariat identifies that Jurisdiction
D has five preferential regimes (step 1) of which two are in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2).
The Secretariat presents the two regimes to the FHTP  under step 3. The FHTP concludes by
consensus that the regimes should not undergo a BEPS impact assessment and therefore, the
Secretariat records these regimes in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the
FHTP (list 3).
• Example 4: The facts are the same as in example 3, exce pt that the FHTP decides that one in -
scope regime from Jurisdiction D is to be reviewed (step 3). The Secretariat performs a BEPS
impact assessment (step 4) and concludes that the regime is only used by two taxpayers in the
last five years for a total amou nt of income of EUR 100k. The FHTP concludes that there is no
expected significant BEPS impact and that the regime is “not harmful”. The regime is included in
the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
• Example 5: Jurisdiction E introduces a logistic services regime and identifies this to the Secretariat
(step 1). The Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). The
regime is included in the list of regimes to be potentially submitted to a  BEPS impact assessment
(list 2) and the FHTP decides that the regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step
3). The Secretariat undertakes the BEPS impact assessment (step 4), and concludes that, since
this is a new regime, no definite conclusion c an be reached. The FHTP decides that there will be
no legislative review at this stage, but that the regime will be monitored for three years. The regime
is included as “under review” in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes as well as in the list of regimes
for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).
• Example 6: Jurisdiction F provides for an economic zone regime that the FHTP previously
determined to be “in the process of being amended”. With the adoption of the revised methodology,
the regime becomes subject to that methodology. Jurisdiction G identifies the regime (step 1) and
the Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope (step 2). The Secretariat includes the regime
in the list of regimes to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact as sessment (list 2), and the
FHTP decides that the regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step 3). The
Secretariat undertakes the BEPS impact assessment (step 4) and proposes that there is no
expected significant BEPS impact. On that basis, the FHTP adopts as a conclusion that the regime
is “not harmful”. The regime is included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by
the FHTP (list 3).
• Example 7: The Secretariat identifies that Jurisdiction H has an insurance regime (step 1) which is
in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). The Secretariat includes the regime in the list of regimes
to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact assessment (list 2), and the FHTP decides that the
regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step 3). The Secretariat undertakes the BEPS
impact assessment (step 4) and proposes a legislative review because it could have a significant
BEPS impact. On that basis, the FHTP decides on a consensus minus -one basis to undertake a
legislative review under step 5. During the legislative review, the FHTP concludes that the regime
meets the gateway criterion of a no or low effective tax rate. In addition, the FHTP concludes that
the regime lacks substantial activities requirements. Finally, the FHTP also concludes t hat the
regime is ring -fenced, because the benefits are provided only to foreign -sourced income. The
FHTP decides that the regime can be concluded as “harmful”. Jurisdiction H makes a commitment
to amend the regime, and therefore, the FHTP concludes in its  public lists of regimes that the
regime is “in the process of being amended”. In the absence of such a commitment, the FHTP
would have concluded the regime in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes as “harmful”.

Reducing the scope and frequency of monitoring and peer review exercises
Introduction
The FHTP undertakes annual monitoring and peer review exercises. More specifically, it monitors certain
aspects of regimes and the substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions and it
reviews jurisdictions’ implementation of the transparency framework that was set out in BEPS Action 5
Report (OECD, 2015[2]).
The FHTP now has several years of experience with the annual monitoring and peer review proce sses.
The annual monitoring for regimes started in 2018, and the annual monitoring for no or only nominal tax
jurisdictions in 2020. The peer review of the transparency framework commenced in 2017.
Under the revised methodology set out in this section, th at certain monitoring processes will be
discontinued and that the frequency of other monitoring process and the peer review of the transparency
framework, will be reduced. These changes are aimed at decreasing the burden on both assessed
jurisdictions and the FHTP, while maintaining the progress made and the integrity and value of the
monitoring exercise.
In summary, the Inclusive Framework agreed  that the FHTP will reduce the scope of the monitoring of
preferential regimes, by discontinuing the annual monitoring exercise for: (i) third category of IP assets and
rebuttable presumption in IP regimes, (ii) potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes, (iii)
disadvantaged areas regimes, and (iv) grandfathered non -IP regimes. Furthermore, for substantial
activities in non-IP regimes and substantial activities in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions, the frequency
of monitoring will be reduced, i.e. once every three years, as opposed to the current annual cycle.
Reduction of the scope of the monitoring of preferential regimes
Certain aspects of IP regimes
The BEPS Action 5 nexus approach sets out the substantial activities requirements for IP regimes. One of
the features of the nexus approach is to define the categories of IP assets that are eligible for preferential
tax treatment.  There are three categories of qualifying IP assets: the first category is patents defined
broadly; the second category is copyrighted software; and the third category is an additional category
applicable in certain more limited circumstances, where the asset is similar in nature to the former two, but
has not been subject to the patent approval process.
The purpose of allowing this third category of IP assets is to recognise that for SMEs, the patent process
may be prohibitively expensive and very lengthy. In addition, the Inclusive Framework agreed that allowing
smaller companies to benefit from the IP regime would not appear to pose a significant BEPS -risk. The
BEPS Action 5 Report  (OECD, 2015[2]) allowed the third category of IP assets, provided that the FHTP
would annually monitor this category and jurisdictions would spontaneously exchange information on
taxpayers benefitting from this category (using the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework).
Furthermore, the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]) allows jurisdictions to treat the nexus ratio as a
rebuttable presumption. In this scenario, a jurisdiction determines the income receiving tax benefits based
on the nexus ratio, but permits taxpayers to prove that more income should be permitted to benefit from
the IP regime in exceptional circumstances where taxpayers that have undertaken substantial qualifying
R&D activity in developing a qualifying IP asset or product can establish that the application of the nexus
fraction leads to an outcome where the level of income eligible for a preferential IP regime is not
commensurate with the level of their R&D activity. The application of this rebuttable presumption is subject
to specific requirements, in particular that the FHTP would annually monitor this category and that
