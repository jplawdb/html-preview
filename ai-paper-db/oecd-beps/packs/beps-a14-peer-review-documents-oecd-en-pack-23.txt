Annex 3.C. Definition of terms and rules for
counting MAP cases for purposes of MAP
Statistics reporting under the reporting template
in Annex 3.A.
1. Jurisdictions shall apply the following definitions and counting methods for purposes of their MAP
Statistics reporting as required under Annex 3.A. of this note:
(a) MAP case
(i) Countries that are currently reporting MAP Statistics1 pursuant to the MAP reporting framework
arising from the proposals in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs' (CFA) 2007 report “Improving the
Resolution of Tax Treaty Disputes”2 (“existing reporting framework”) could adopt the definition
of MAP cases based on the definition as contain ed in that framework and should clearly
indicate this in the “Notes” section. As required under the existing reporting framework, where
a tax administration does not accept a definition or is unable to report based upon the definition,
that administration is requested to explain the difference between its reporting and the definition
of terms provided in the existing reporting framework. Such explanation should be contained
in the “Notes” section.
(ii) For all other jurisdictions, they should clearly indicate  in the “Notes” section the definition of a
MAP case adopted by them.
(b) Counting of MAP cases
(i) Countries that are currently reporting MAP Statistics pursuant to the existing reporting
framework could adopt the counting method contained in that framework and to clearly indicate
that in the “Notes” section. If a different counting method is adopted instead, please explain the
different method used in the “Notes” section.
(ii) For all other jurisdictions, they should clearly indicate in “Notes” section the method of counting
MAP cases.
(c) Category of Cases (Attribution / Allocation and Others) – See Column 1
Jurisdictions could categorise pre -2016 cases based on any definition adopted by them and explain the
definition used in the “Notes” section.
(d) Number of pre-2016 cases in MAP inventory on 1 January [YEAR] – See Column 2
The number of pre -2016 cases in the MAP inventory on 1 January of the year is the number of MAP
requests that are not reported in Annex 3.B. which are pending resolution as of 1 January of that year.
(e) Number of cases closed during the reporting period with outcomes as stated in
Columns 3 to Column 12
(i)      Cases denied MAP access (Column 3):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case denied MAP access if the date of notification from the
competent authority to the taxpayer that its MAP request is denied access to MAP (see

paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. A MAP request is denied
MAP access if it not an admissible objection or is denied access to MAP for any other reason.
In instance whereby the taxpayer had sought the decision of an administrative appeal or judicial
review following the notification from the competent authority that the MAP request is denied
MAP access, and the decision is such that the case should be granted MAP access, this case
shall be considered as a new case with the “start” date determined as (i) date of the decision
of the administrative appeal or judicial review; or (ii) where the taxpayer is required to submit a
new MAP request, the date as determined by the competent authority.
(ii) Objection is not justified (Column 4):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case where the objection is not justified if the date of
notification from the compet ent authority to the taxpayer that its objection is not a justified
objection (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. In instance
whereby the taxpayer had sought the decision of an administrative appeal or judicial review
following the notification from the competent authority that the objection from the taxpayer is
not justified, and the decision is such that the case is a justified request, this case shall be
considered as a new case with the “start” date determined as ( i) date of the decision of the
administrative appeal or judicial review; or (ii) where the taxpayer is required to submit a new
MAP request, the date as determined by the competent authority.
(iii) Withdrawn by taxpayer (Column 5):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case withdrawn by the taxpayer if the date of receipt of the
taxpayer’s notification to the competent authority (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls
within the reporting period. However, if the case is withdrawn by taxpayer following the
resolution of the issues through remedies provided by the domestic law of a Contracting State,
that case shall be reflected as a case closed with the outcome “resolved via domestic remedy”
(see Column 7).
(iv) Unilateral relief granted (Column 6):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with unilateral relief granted if the date of
notification from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an
outcome (see paragraphs 13and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting  period. Such cases
shall not include cases whereby unilateral relief will be granted by a Contracting State following
the outcome reached via (i) domestic remedy (such outcome shall be reflected under Column
7); and (ii) competent authority agreement (suc h outcome shall be reflected in either Column
8 or 9).
(v) Resolved via domestic remedy (Column 7):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with the outcome “ resolved via domestic
remedy” if the date of that outcome (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this no te) falls within the
reporting period. If the case is withdrawn by the taxpayer following an outcome reached via
domestic remedy which lead to unilateral relief granted by a jurisdiction, that case shall be
reflected as a case under this column and not as a case withdrawn (see Column 5) or closed
with unilateral relief granted (see Column 6).
(vi) Agreement fully eliminating double taxation / fully resolving taxation not in accordance with tax
treaty (Column 8):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreement fully eliminating double taxation
/ fully resolving taxation not in accordance with tax treaty if the date of notification from the
competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an agreement reached via
competent authority discussion (regardless of whether the taxpayer accepts that outcome) (see
paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. This includes cases where
