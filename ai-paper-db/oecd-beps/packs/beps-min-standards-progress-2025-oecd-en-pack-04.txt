Annex A. Revised methodology for the work of
the FHTP
Revised methodology for the review of preferential regimes
Introduction
The FHTP’s work of reviewing preferential regimes started in 1998, which is almost 30 years ago. During
these years, the FHTP has reviewed preferential regimes to avoid them creating harmful tax competition.
The FHTP’s reviews focus on regimes that provide benefits to business income from geographically mobile
activities (i.e. regimes within the FHTP’s scope). These regimes can pose BEPS -risks if they contain
potentially harmful features.
Since the start of the BEPS project, and with the formation of the I nclusive Framework, the FHTP has
expanded its scope of reviews beyond those of OECD Member States to encompass the full membership
of the Inclusive Framework. 1 Since the start of the BEPS project the FHTP has reviewed a total of 332
regimes. The results of these regime reviews are published in the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]),
the 2017 Progress Repor t (OECD, 2017[8]), the 2018 Progress Report  (OECD, 2019[9]) and on a regular
basis on the OECD’s website as new results become available.
In recent years, there have been an increasing number of instances where preferential regimes that pose
a limited BEPS risk are technically in the scope of the FHTP work (e.g. free trade zone regimes that permit
a wide range of activities and provide a preferential tax rate, including for services or Intellectual Property
(IP)). This is mainly because these regimes primarily or almost e xclusively target non -geographically
mobile activities such as manufacturing, warehousing, primary resource exploitation and agriculture, while
technically still allowing service income and income from IP to benefit from the regime. In addition, the
FHTP has also reviewed regimes that have a (very) limited uptake and therefore pose little BEPS -risks.
Under the previous methodology, the first step of an FHTP review was to undertake a legislative review of
a preferential regime before conducting an impact ass essment in respect of the BEPS -risk. This
methodology has in certain cases, especially in recent years, led to (often new) Inclusive Framework
members being required to adjust their legislation to comply with the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard,
prior to finding evidence of BEPS risks.
For these reasons, the Inclusive Framework has revised the methodology for the review of regimes so that
they will commence with an initial BEPS impact assessment, before conducting the legislative review. The
revised methodology ensures that those preferential regimes that are unlikely to lead to BEPS -risks are
not upfront subjected to a legislative review by the FHTP, therewith streamlining the FHTP’s work and
strengthening the focus on preferential regimes that are material  for maintaining the integrity of the BEPS
1 In addition, some preferential regimes with harmful features may be offered by jurisdictions that are not members of
the Inclusive Framework. In order to ensure a level playing field, such jurisdictions are able to be identified by the
members of the Inclusive Framework as being relevant to the work and are reviewed according to the same criteria
as apply for all other jurisdictions. These are “jurisdictions of relevance”.

Action 5 minimum standard and the level playing field.  The revised methodology is effective from its
adoption at the Inclusive Framework’s April 2025 Plenary meeting.
This chapter sets out the revised methodology, which can be summarised as follows:
• Step 1. Identification of regimes that may be within the FHTP’s scope. This identification will initially
be made by the jurisdiction itself, by another Inclusive Framework member or by the FHTP
Secretariat (hereafter Secretariat);
• Step 2.  Initial assessment by the Secretariat to determine whether the regime falls within the
FHTP’s scope;
• Step 3.  Compilation of regimes (potentially) to be reviewed by the FHTP, based on identified
regimes that are determined to be within the scope of the FHTP. This list will be divided into:
1. a list of regimes for which the jurisdiction providing the preferential regime opts for an
immediate legislative review by the FHTP under Step 5 (thereby bypassing Step 4);
2. a list of regimes for which a BEPS impact assessment under Step 4 is to be considered by the
FHTP; and
3. a list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP including those for which no
BEPS impact assessment or legislative review is undertaken;
• Step 4. BEPS impact assessment, with the following possible conclusions:
o the regime could have a significant BEPS impact and the FHTP should undertake a legislative
review of the regime; or
o the regime currently does not have a significant BEPS impact  and the FHTP should not
undertake a legislative review of the regime at this moment; or
o the BEPS impact assessment of the regime is currently inconclusive and the FHTP does not
undertake a legislative review of the regime at this moment, but it will be sub ject to ongoing
monitoring for three years;
• Step 5. Legislative review.
