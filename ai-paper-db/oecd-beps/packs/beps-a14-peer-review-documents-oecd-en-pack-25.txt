is subject to domestic rules on fiscal unity or similar concepts), the request concerns the
transactions of only one such entity in either Contracting State or in each Contracting State.
In these circumstances, a MAP request will be counted as one cas e, irrespective of whether (i) the MAP
request is submitted by the taxpayer to one or more competent authorities; (ii) the number of issues and
taxation years involved, so long as these issues and taxation years are covered in the same MAP request;
and (iii) the MAP request is submitted to the competent authorities under both a tax treaty and the EU
Arbitration Convention/Dispute Resolution Directive.
Where in either or both Contracting States, a MAP request concerns the taxation of more than one taxpayer
or concerns more than one entity, then -
 if the number of taxpayers or entities concerned in each Contracting State is the same, the number
of MAP cases shall be equal to this number, or
 if the number of taxpayers or entities concerned in each Contracting State is different, the number
of MAP cases shall be equal to the larger number.
Any subsequent request by the same taxpayer or the same entity with respect to a similar issue but for a
different taxation year or with respect to the same taxation year for a different issue shall be considered to
be a new MAP request and the number of MAP cases arising from this new request shall be counted as
described above.
(c) Attribution/Allocation MAP Cases – see Table 1 of Part (I) and Part (II) of Annex 3.B.
An attribution/allocation MAP case is a MAP case where the taxpayer’s MAP request relates to (i) the
attribution of profits to a permanent establishment (see e.g. Article 7 of the OECD Model T ax Convention
(OECD, 2019[2])); or (ii) the determination of profits between associated enterprises (see e.g. Article 9 of
the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD, 2019[2])), which is also known as a transfer pricing MAP case.
(d) Other MAP Cases – see Table 2 of Part (I) and Part (II) of Annex 3.B.
Any MAP case that is not an attribution / allocation MAP case shall be reported as “Others” in Table 2 of
Part (I) and Part (II) of Annex 3.B.
2. Jurisdictions shall apply the following definitions and counting methods for purposes of their MAP
Statistics reporting as required under Part (I) of Annex 3.B. of this note:
(a) Number of post-2015 cases closed during the reporting period with outcomes as
stated in Columns 4 to 13 of Table 1 and Table 2
(i) Cases denied MAP access (Column 4):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case denied MAP access if the date of notification from the
competent authority to the taxpayer that its  MAP request is denied access to MAP (see
paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. A MAP request is denied
MAP access if it not an admissible objection or is denied access to MAP for any other reason.
In instance whereby the taxpayer had sought the decision of an administrative appeal or judicial
review following the notification from the competent authority that the MAP request is denied
MAP access, and the decision is such that the case should be granted MAP access, this case
shall be considered as a new case with the “start” date determined as (i) date of the decision
of the administrative appeal or judicial review; or (ii) where the taxpayer is required to submit a
new MAP request, the date as determined based on paragraphs 11 or  12 of this note.
(ii) Objection is not justified (Column 5):

A MAP case shall be counted as a case where the objection is not justified if the date of
notification from the competent authority to the taxpayer that its objection is not a justified
objection (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. In instance
whereby the taxpayer had sought the decision of an administrative appeal or judicial review
following the notification from the competent authority that the objection  from the taxpayer is
not justified, and the decision is such that the case is a justified request, this case shall be
considered as a new case with the “start” date determined as (i) date of the decision of the
administrative appeal or judicial review; or  (ii) where the taxpayer is required to submit a new
MAP request, the date as determined based on paragraph 11 or 12 of this note.
(iii) Withdrawn by taxpayer (Column 6):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case withdrawn by the taxpayer if the date of receipt  of the
taxpayer’s notification to the competent authority (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls
within the reporting period. However, if the case is withdrawn by taxpayer following the
resolution of the issues through remedies provided by the domestic law of a Contracting State,
that case shall be reflected as a case closed with the outcome “resolved via domestic remedy”
(see Column 8).
(iv) Unilateral relief granted (Column 7):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with unilateral relief gran ted if the date of
notification from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an
outcome (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. Such cases
shall not include cases whereby unilateral relief will be granted by a Contracting State following
the outcome reached via (i) domestic remedy (such outcome shall be reflected under Column
8); and (ii) competent authority agreement (such outcome shall be reflected in either Column
9 or 10).
(v) Resolved via domestic remedy (Column 8):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with the outcome “resolved via domestic
remedy” if the date of that outcome (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the
reporting period. If the case is withdrawn by th e taxpayer following an outcome reached via
domestic remedy which lead to unilateral relief granted by a jurisdiction, that case shall be
reflected as a case under this column and not as a case withdrawn (see Column 6) or closed
with unilateral relief granted (see Column 7).
(vi) Agreement fully eliminating double taxation / fully resolving taxation not in accordance with tax
treaty (Column 9):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreement fully eliminating double taxation
/ fully resolving taxa tion not in accordance with tax treaty if the date of notification from the
competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an agreement reached via
competent authority discussion (regardless of whether the taxpayer accepts that outcome) (see
paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period. This includes cases where
such an outcome is arrived at following the submission of the case to arbitration in instances
where the tax treaty contains an arbitration provision.
(vii) Agreement partially eliminating double taxation / partially resolving taxation not in accordance
with the tax treaty (Column 10):
A MAP case shall be counted as a case closed with agreement partially eliminating double
taxation / partially resolving taxatio n not in accordance with the tax treaty if the date of
notification from the competent authority to the taxpayer informing the taxpayer of such an
agreement reached via competent authority discussion (regardless of whether the taxpayer
accepts that outcome) (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this note) falls within the reporting period.
