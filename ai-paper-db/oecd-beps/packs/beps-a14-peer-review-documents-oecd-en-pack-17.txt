MAP process
5. Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019[2]) provides for a MAP mechanism,
independent from the legal remedies available under domestic la w, through which the competent
authorities of the Contracting States to a tax treaty (“ Contracting States ”) may resolve differences or
difficulties regarding the interpretation or application of the tax treaty on a mutually-agreed basis. The MAP
mechanism is of fundamental importance to the proper application and interpretation of tax treaties, notably
to ensure that taxpayers entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty are not subject to taxation by either of the
Contracting States which is not in accordance with the provisions of the tax treaty. In this regard, paragraph
1 of Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019 [2]) provides that where a taxpayer
considers that the actions of one or both Contracting States result or will result for that taxpayer in taxation
not in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, the taxpayer may, irrespective of the remedies provided
by the domestic law of those States, make a request to the competent authority of either Contracting State.
6. Prior to the adoption of the Action 14 minimum standard, Article 25(1) stipulated that a taxpayer
could submit a MAP request to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident
or, if the case comes under the pr ovisions relating to the Non -Discrimination Article 2, to that of the
Contracting State of which the taxpayer is a national. With the 2017 update of the OECD Model Tax
Convention (OECD, 2019 [2]), Article 25(1) has been amended to allow taxpayers to submit their MAP
request to the competent authority of either Contracting State, such to ensure that both competent
authorities are aware of the MAP request being submitted and are able to give their views on whether the
request is accepted or rejected and on whether the taxpayer’s objection is considered to be justified. The
Commentary on Article 25 further explains that the taxpayer may present its case to the competent
authority of either Contracting State and the taxpayer i s not precluded from presenting its case to the
competent authority of both Contracting States at the same time. Where the taxpayer submits the MAP
request to both competent authorities at the same time, he should appropriately inform both competent
authorities, in order to facilitate a co-ordinated approach to the case.3
7. The Action 14 minimum standard allows jurisdictions the option to include in their tax treaties either
Article 25(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention  (OECD, 2019[2]) as amended with the 2017 update, or
as it previously read in the 2014 version. Where the treaty in place between the Contracting States contains
Article 25(1) as it read in its 2014 version – thus allowing taxpayers to submit a MAP request  to the
competent authority of the Contracting State in which he is a resident (or, if the case comes under the
provisions relating to the Non-discrimination Article, to that of the Contracting State of which the taxpayer
is a national) – jurisdictions are under the Action 14 minimum standard required to implement a bilateral
consultation or notification process to be applied when its competent authority does not consider the
taxpayer’s objection to be justified and which allows the other competent authorit y to provide its views on
the case (such consultation shall not be interpreted as consultation as to how to resolve the case).
8. To be admissible, a case presented under paragraph 1 of Article 25 must be presented within the
timeframe stipulated in the tax treaty from the first notification of the action which gives rise to taxation not
in accordance with the tax treaty. Once a case that meets the requirements of paragraph 1 of Article 25
has been accepted, the competent authority to which the case was presented must determine whether the
taxpayer’s objection appears to be justified. If that is the case, that competent authority may be able to
resolve the case unilaterally, e.g. where the taxation contrary to the provisions of the tax treaty is due in
whole or in part to a measure taken in the Contracting State to which the taxpayer has presented its MAP
case. A MAP case that has been accepted will only move to the second, bilateral stage of the MAP process
where it meets two requirements provided by paragraph 2 of Article 25: (i) the taxpayer’s objection appear
to be justified to the competent authority to which it has been presented and (ii) that competent authority
is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory unilateral solution. Paragraph 2 of Article 25 n o doubt entails a
duty to negotiate; but as far as reaching mutual agreement through the procedure is concerned, the
competent authorities are under a duty merely to use their best endeavours and not to achieve a result. 4

9. The MAP process to the extent it i s relevant for MAP Statistics reporting purposes, in particular
the relevant milestones along with their Commentary, is set out below.

10. Element C.2 of the Terms of Reference requires that jurisdictions seek to resolve MAP cases
within an average time frame of 24 months. Given the collaborative approach to be taken by competent
authorities to achieve the common objective to resolve MAP case s in a timely manner, this timeframe
applies to both jurisdictions (i.e. the jurisdiction that receives the MAP request from the taxpayer and its
treaty partner). To compute the average time taken to resolve MAP cases, the “start” date and “end” date
for each MAP case should be determined as below. Competent authorities should communicate effectively
with each other to ensure that they have common data points for the purposes of MAP Statistics reporting.
The data points for each MAP request include (i) the “start” date; (ii) the date of Milestone 1 (if applicable);
(iii) the “end” date; and (iv) the number of MAP cases involved in a MAP request. 5
(i) Starting of MAP case (“start” date)
11. Given the collaborative approach to be taken by competent authorities to  achieve the common
objective to resolve MAP cases in a timely manner, it is important that both competent authorities are well
aware of the MAP request. In this regard, the competent authority that receives the MAP request from the
taxpayer should notify the other competent authority of the request within a target time frame of four weeks
from the receipt of the taxpayer’s MAP request. Such notification should include at least the following: (a)
identification of the taxpayer(s) concerned (e.g. name and ad dress, tax identification number(s) or birth
date (where appropriate)); (b) tax years covered; (c) brief issue(s) (e.g. the article(s) concerned and
whether the MAP case is an attribution/allocation case); and (d) the date of receipt of the taxpayer’s MAP
request and the taxpayer’s covering letter (where appropriate). This notification should also include the
contact details (e.g. contact number and email) of the official(s) handling the MAP request to facilitate
efficient communication between the competen t authorities on the MAP case concerned. The competent
authority that receives the notification is given the opportunity, if it so wishes, to confirm receipt of the
notification and any such confirmation should be made within one week of the date of the notification. The
notification and any confirmation of receipt should as much as possible be made by electronic means to
accelerate the communication process.
