RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens
Given the refinements  to the peer review methodology for Action 13 agreed in 2020 , the Inclusive
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further procedural changes are required at
this time, but may be considered once the review of the minimum standard it self is completed, at which
time the peer review will need to be revised to reflect changes to the standard.
Therefore, with implementation now at a mature stage, the work of BEPS Action 13 is focused on ensuring
that all Inclusive Framework members – in particular developing countries – can effectively access and
use CbC reports effectively. While many developing countries have introduced domestic legislation
requiring the filing of CbC reports and others have draft legislation in progress , fewer have completed the
technical steps needed to receive reports under the automatic exchange  of information framework. To
close this gap, a targeted approach will now be deployed empowering developing country members to set
their own implementation timelines for acces sing CbC reports  and receive tailored support  from the
Secretariat.
Close e ngagement with developing countries has further highlighted that access to suitable IT tools
remains a major barrier to receiving and using CbC reports. While larger jurisdictions have developed or
purchased advanced systems, these are often too costly and complex for developing countries with limited
reporting volumes. To address this, the Inclusive Framework is exploring options  to make available low-
or no-cost IT solutions tailored to the needs of developing countries. These tools, combined with access
to the OECD Common Transmission System, are expected to significantly facilitate access to CbC reports
by all interested developing countries.
BEPS Action 14 – Mutual Agreement Procedures
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard
The minimum standard included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 14 (OECD, 2015[7]) aims to improve
tax treaty dispute resolution through three core principles: timely and good -faith implementation of Mutual
Agreement Procedures (MAP) obligations, effective administrative processes, and g uaranteed access to
MAP for eligible taxpayers. These principles have been operationalised through 21 measurable elements
assessed via a peer review process.
As implementation has matured, the peer reviews for the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard have yielded
tangible results in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness of MAP across Inclusive
Framework’s jurisdictions. Over 500 treaties have been modified by the BEPS MLI to incorporate effective
MAP provisions, while other jurisdictions h ave taken or plan  to take bilateral actions to modify their tax
treaties. Access to MAP is available in most eligible cases, with several issues being effectively addressed
through recommendations in the peer review process.
Progress in the implementation of BEPS Action 14 is further reflected in the widespread publication of MAP
guidance and profiles  by most peer -reviewed jurisdictions , as well as by notable  improvements in the
organisation of competent authority functions . These advancements h ave enabled many jurisdictions to
get much closer to the target of resolving MAP cases within an average timeframe of 24 months.
To date, 82 jurisdictions in the Inclusive Framework have completed the peer review processes. A revised
peer review approach now includes  a full peer review process for experienced MAP jurisdictions and a
simplified peer review process for jurisdictions with limited or no MAP experience.
The full peer review process is currently assessing 58 of jurisdictions with meaningful MAP experience in
meeting the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard. Additionally, 68 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions with
limited or no MAP experience have undergone or are currently undergoing a simplified peer review

process, with reports for 20 jurisdictions already publ ished, and another 17 scheduled for review in the
coming months. Jurisdictions also report statistics related to their tax certainty obligations under BEPS
Action 14. The ongoing collection of information ensures transparency, with information about each
jurisdiction’s MAP function available through published MAP guidance or MAP profiles.
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens
Given the recent updates to the peer review methodology for Action 1 4 agreed in 202 3, the Inclusive
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further changes are required at this time.
Therefore, as the implementation of  BEPS Action 14 reaches a mature phase, attention has shifted to
ensuring that all members – particularly developing countries – can fully benefit from effective MAP
processes. Developing countries that were initially excluded from peer reviews as they were in the process
of setting up a MAP function are now gaining MAP e xperience and are engaging in peer review process
for managing MAP caseloads efficiently and effectively, in line with the objectives of BEPS Action 14.
This has also been reflected in the simplified peer review process for jurisdictions without meaningful MAP
experience, aimed at helping them build a strong foundation for future cases, alongside a full review for
jurisdictions with more established MAP practices. Early results show strong commitment, particularly from
lower-capacity jurisdictions, which have welcomed the simplified process as a valuable tool for developing
their MAP frameworks and allocating necessary resources.
These efforts are further reinforced by targeted capacity -building initiatives, such as MAP workshops for
developing country officials, offering practical training on dispute resolution under  BEPS Action 14.
