mandatory or not. Elements B.5 and B.10 of the Terms of Reference should therefore not be interpreted as including
any implicit commitment with respect to these other obligations.
15 Taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments are taxpayer -initiated adjustments permitted under the domestic laws of a
treaty partner which allow a taxpayer under appropriate circumstances to amend a previously-filed tax return to adjust
(i) the price for a transaction between associate d enterprises or (ii) the profits attributable to a permanent
establishment, with a view to reporting a result that is, in the view of the taxpayer, in accordance with the arm’s length
principle. For such purposes, a taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustment should be considered bona fide where it reflects
the good faith effort of the taxpayer to report correctly the taxable income from a controlled transaction or the profits
attributable to a permanent establishment and where the taxpayer has otherwise timely and properly fulfilled all of its
obligations related to such taxable income or profits under the tax laws of the two Contracting Parties. (see Best
Practice 9 in the Action 14 Report)
16 See paragraph 2 of Article 25 and its Commentary.
17 A MAP case for this purpose refers to a MAP case that is received by a competent authority from the taxpayer on
or after 1 January 2016 and is defined in Annex 3.D. of the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework.
18 The average time frame to resolve MAP cases shall be computed in accordance with the method of computation
provided in the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework. The “start date” and “end date” for purposes of computing the
time taken to resolve a MAP case is defined in the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework. These stat istical purposes
should be distinguished from the purposes of time frames in arbitration provisions; the time frames relevant in that
latter context must be determined based on the provisions of the relevant arbitration clause and/or relevant competent
authority agreements on the application of such clause.
19 Given that the average time frame in element C.2. applies to both jurisdictions, in the review of an assessed
jurisdiction, if the average time taken to resolve MAP cases exceeds 24 months arising from  delays caused by its
treaty partners, such delays shall not lead to a recommendation that the assessed jurisdiction needs to improve the
average time taken to resolve MAP cases.
20 A jurisdiction should provide its position on arbitration in its MAP profil e which should be published on a shared
public platform. In addition, OECD members and non -OECD economies which have set out their positions on the
OECD Model Tax Convention should provide their position on arbitration in the OECD Model Tax Convention.
21 The public guidance should address, in particular,  whether the competent authority considers itself to be legally
bound to follow a domestic court decision in the MAP or whether the competent authority will not deviate from a
domestic court decision as a matter of administrative policy or practice.
22 See second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 25 and its Commentary.
23 See paragraph 62 of the Commentary on Article 7 and paragraph 10 of the Commentary on Article 9.

Annex 1.A. Mandate for the development of the
Terms of Reference and the Assessment
Methodology
Pursuant to element 1.6 of the Action 14 minimum standard, countries commit to have their compl iance
with the minimum standard reviewed by their peers – i.e. the other members of the FTA MAP Forum (as
provided in element 1.4 of the minimum standard, countries should become members of the FTA MAP
Forum and participate fully in its work). This review will take place through a monitoring mechanism, the
framework for which is described in Section I.C of this Report. Such monitoring is essential to ensure the
meaningful implementation of the minimum standard and will be conducted pursuant to Terms of
Reference and an Assessment Methodology to be developed by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs
through its Working Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questi ons (Working Party 1) and the
Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum (the FTA MAP Forum). The mandate for the development of the
Terms of Reference and the Assessment Methodology is set out below:
Preamble
Recognising that the conclusions of the work on Action 14 of the BEPS Action Plan reflect the agreement
that countries should commit to a minimum standard comprising a number of specific elements that are
intended to ensure that treaty-related disputes are resolved in a timely, effective and efficient manner;
Noting that the conclusions of the work on Action 14 also include agreement that the implem entation of
the minimum standard should be evaluated through a peer monitoring mechanism in order to ensure that
the commitments embodied in the minimum standard are effectively satisfied, and that all OECD and G20
countries, as well as jurisdictions that commit to the minimum standard, will undergo reviews pursuant to
that monitoring mechanism;
Considering that the peer monitoring process will require the development of Terms of Reference that will
be used to assess the implementation of the Action 14 mini mum standard and of an Assessment
Methodology that will establish procedures and guidelines for the peer monitoring process;
The countries participating in the OECD-G20 BEPS Project have agreed that Terms of Reference and an
Assessment Methodology will be developed by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, through its Working
Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questions and the Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum
(the FTA MAP Forum) pursuant to the following mandate.
A. Objective
The OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs through its Working Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related
Questions and the Forum on Tax Administration MAP Forum (the FTA MAP Forum) shall develop the core
documents for the monitoring of the implementation of the Action 14 minimum  standard: the Terms of
Reference and the Assessment Methodology. The Terms of Reference  will be based on the elements of
the minimum standard and will break down these elements into specific aspects against which jurisdictions’
legal frameworks, MAP progr amme guidance and actual implementation of the minimum standard are
assessed; they will provide a clear roadmap for the monitoring process and thereby ensure that the
assessment of all jurisdictions is consistent and complete. The Assessment Methodology  will establish
detailed procedures and guidelines for the peer monitoring of OECD and G20 countries and other

committed jurisdictions by the FTA MAP Forum, which will be open to all such countries participating on
an equal footing and will include a system for assessing the implementation of the minimum standard.
B. Participation
The Terms of Reference  and the Assessment Methodology  shall be developed jointly by the OECD
Committee on Fiscal Affairs, through its Working Party 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questions, and
the FTA MAP Forum, with all countries participating on an equal footing.
C. Duration and term
The development of the Terms of Reference and the Assessment Methodology shall start no later than
November 2015. Working Party 1 and the FTA MAP Forum shall aim to conclude their work on the Terms
of Reference and the Assessment Methodology by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
