Foreword 
Digitalisation and globalisation have had a profound impact on economies and the lives of people around 
the world, and this impact has only accelerated in the 21st century. These changes have brought with them 
challenges to the rules for taxing international business income, which have prevailed for  more than a 
hundred years and created opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), requiring bold moves 
by policy makers to restore confidence in the system and ensure that profits are taxed where economic 
activities take place and value is created. 
In 2013, the OECD ramped up efforts to address these challenges in response to growing public and 
political concerns about tax avoidance by large multinationals. The OECD and G20 countries joined forces 
and developed an Action Plan to address BEPS in September 2013. The Action Plan identified 15 actions 
aimed at introducing coherence in the domestic rules that affect cross -border activities, reinforcing 
substance requirements in the existing international standards, and improving transparency as we ll as 
certainty. 
After two years of work, measures in response to the 15 actions, including those published in an interim 
form in 2014, were consolidated into a comprehensive package and delivered to G20 Leaders in November 
2015. The BEPS package represents the first substantial renovation of the international tax rules in almost 
a century. The implementation of BEPS measures strengthens the international tax system by ensuring 
that BEPS planning strategies identified that relied on outdated rules or on poo rly co-ordinated domestic 
measures have been rendered ineffective. 
OECD and G20 countries also agreed to continue to work together to ensure a consistent and co-ordinated 
implementation of the BEPS recommendations and to make the project more inclusive. As  a result, they 
created the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Inclusive Framework), bringing all interested and 
committed countries and jurisdictions on an equal footing in the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs and its 
subsidiary bodies. With over 145 m embers, the Inclusive Framework monitors and peer reviews the 
implementation of the minimum standards and is advancing the work on standard setting to address further 
BEPS issues. In addition to its members, other international organisations and regional t ax bodies are 
involved in the work of the Inclusive Framework, which also consults business and the civil society on its 
different work streams. 
The work to address BEPS has also led to further consideration of the tax challenges arising from the 
digitalisation of the economy. In October 2021, over 135 Inclusive Framework members agreed to a 
political statement on the Two -Pillar Solution to reform aspects of the international taxation rules in order 
to ensure that the profits of multinational enterprises ar e fairly taxed in today’s digitalised and globalised 
world economy. That work has made significant advances in developing a co-ordinated system for 
reallocating taxing rights to market jurisdictions with respect to a defined portion of the residual profits  of 
the largest and most profitable Multinationals (the Multilateral Convention to implement Amount A of Pillar 
One). The work has also resulted in an agreement on simplified and streamlined transfer pricing 
methodologies for certain baseline distribution activities which were incorporated into the Transfer Pricing 
Guidelines as of February 2024 (Pillar One Amount B).  Furthermore, jurisdictions are making treaty 
changes to allow developing countries to charge a minimum rate on certain intra -group cross -border

payments (Pillar Two Subject-to-Tax Rule); and a jurisdictional 15% minimum effective tax rate framework 
has been implemented by more than 55 jurisdictions as of the beginning of 2025 (Pillar Two GloBE Rules). 
This work continues, and at their its meeting in April 2025, Inclusive Framework members reiterated  the 
critical importance of securing certainty and stability in the international tax system from the ongoing work 
on BEPS and the Two-Pillar Solution.   
This document presents the recommendations endorsed by the Inclusive Framework at the April 
2025 plenary meeting and includes, as an annex, the revised peer review methodology for the Forum on 
Harmful Tax Practices' work on BEPS Action 5, approved during that meeting.

Introduction  
In 2013, the project on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) was launched. Since then, the BEPS Project 
has resulted in a major update to the international tax system  by equipping governments with rules and 
instruments to ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities generating them take place and 
where value is created.  
Today, more than 145 jurisdictions are members of the  Inclusive Framework  on BEPS (the “Inclusive 
Framework”), participating on an equal footing and working towards the development of a fair and 
sustainable global tax environment. A key f unction of the Inclusive Framework is to monitor progress and 
review the implementation of the four BEPS minimum standards that were identified as part of the 15-point 
BEPS Action Plan published in 2013 (OECD, 2013[1]). Acknowledging their interdependence in addressing 
BEPS-risks, Inclusive Framework jurisdictions commit to implement four BEPS minimum standards which 
cover Action 5 on Harmful Tax Practices, Action 6 on Tax Treaty Abuse, Action 13 on Country-by-Country 
Reporting, and Action 14 on Dispute Resolution. 
Implementation of the four BEPS minimum standards has reached a mature stage , reflecting a strong 
commitment to address BEPS risks across the membership of the Inclusive Framework. In light of this, the 
focus of the work of the Inclusive Framework is now increasingly on making sure that all members – and 
in particular developing countries – can fully benefit from the four minimum standards. To support this 
objective, capacity building programmes and tailored technical assistance are being delivered to ensure 
the swift, efficient and sustainable implementation of the BEPS project in all interested Inclusive 
Framework member countries. 
At the same time, attention has turned to reducing the burdens associated with the peer review processes, 
which have now been running for a number of years,  and strengthening the overall value proposition of 
the minimum standards . This work was initiated at the May 2024 Plenary meeting of the Inclusive 
Framework in Paris and advanced further at Working Party level.  
As a result of this work, the Inclusive Framework, at its April 2025 Plenary meeting in Cape Town, adopted 
a series of recommendations to streamline the peer review processes for the BEPS minimum standards . 
It also endorsed the proposal to introduce targeted adjustments to optimise the allocation of resources 
among Inclusive Framework members, ensuring that efforts remain focused on areas of greatest impact , 
while preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the BEPS minimum standards.  Particular attention has 
been given to strengthening the value proposition of the BEPS Project by identifying priority areas for 
enhanced support , particularly with a  focus on improving access to Country-by-Country reports by  
developing countries. 
This note summarises the outcomes of this  work. It provides a brief overview of the current status of  
implementation of each of the four minimum standards, outlines agreed measures to reduce burdens, and 
Recognising progress and reducing 
burdens in the BEPS minimum standards

highlights renewed priorities for the Inclusive Framework aimed at maintaining progress and future-
proofing the value proposition  of the BEPS Project , including by ensuring that all interested developing 
countries can fully benefit from the work . The revised peer review methodology for BEPS Action 5 on 
Harmful Tax Practices is included in the Annex to this report.  
Looking ahead, the Inclusive Framework will continue to consolidate the progress  achieved so far by 
optimising resource allocation within the  Inclusive Framework Secretariat and enhancing the support for 
jurisdictions with limited resources. In addition, and as announced in the outcome statement of the Inclusive 
Framework Plenary meeting in Cape Town, work is ongoing to take stock of the BEPS work to dat e, with 
a comprehensive report expected to be presented in the last quarter of 2025. 
BEPS Action 5 – Harmful Tax Practices 
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard  
The minimum standard on harmful tax practices  included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 5 (OECD, 
2015[2]) requires Inclusive Framework jurisdictions to introduce substantial activity requirements f or 
preferential regimes and enhance their tax transparency frameworks through the exchange of certain tax 
rulings. Following the publication of the BEPS Final Report on Action 5  (OECD, 2015[2]), the Forum on 
Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) reviewed and refined the framework for identifying harmful tax practices, 
initially established in the 1998 Report  (OECD, 1998[3]), and decided to resume the substantial activities 
factor for no or only nominal tax jurisdictions (OECD, 2018[4]). 
Therefore, the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard encompasses three distinct workstreams. The first  
focuses on preferential regimes based on criteria such as whether the regime is ring-fenced to exclude the 
domestic market or presents a lack of transparency or substantial activit ies requirements. The second is 
assessing no or only nominal corporate tax jurisdictions to ensure they enforce substantial activities 
requirements, accompanied by certain exchange of information obligations for entities raising substance -
related concerns . T he third concerns the transparency framework for  the spontaneous exchange of 
information on certain tax rulings.  
Since the inception of the BEPS project, the FHTP has reviewed 332 preferential regimes for compliance 
with Action 5, with 97% of those regimes having been abolished, amended or otherwise not posing a BEPS 
risk – the remainder are under review or in the process of being amended or abolished. In 2025, the FHTP 
undertook its eighth monitoring exercise for preferential regimes, and concluded that for most preferential 
regimes, the BEPS risk in practice has decreased and jurisdictions have a transparent review mechanism 
in place for ensuring compliance with substantial activities requirements. 
With respect to no or only nominal tax jurisdictions, all of them have enacted legislation to meet the 
substantial activit ies requirements. In this regard, the FHTP undertakes a monitoring exercise  for 
substantial activities requirements in these jurisdictions, covering statistical data, compliance programme 
and exchange of information. Almost all jurisdictions now meet these requirements. Presently, only one of 
the 11 jurisdictions has a ‘hard recommendation’ to address in relation to its enforcement of these 
requirements, and three others have ‘soft recommendations’ to certain issues (e.g. in respect of the 
collection of statistics). 
Regarding the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework on tax rulings , the FHTP conducted its eighth 
annual peer review in 2024 that assessed 136 jurisdictions. Among them, 29 jurisdictions were found not 
to have a legal or operational framework to issue rulings within the scope of the transparency framework . 
A total of 104 jurisdictions did not receive any recommendations. A cumulative total of 58,000 exchanges 
on 26,000 rulings has taken place since the implementation of the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework.

Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens 
In light of the maturity of the BEPS Action 5 implementation, the Inclusive Framework discussed in 2024 a 
renewed fo cus that prioritises burden reduction of the FHTP’s processes , particularly for developing 
countries, and aims to support tax administrations by enabling a more efficient use of resources within both 
jurisdictions and the FHTP Secretariat. 
Building on thes e discussions, t he Inclusive Framework approved at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 a 
revised methodology designed to reduce the burden and frequency of peer review processes while 
preserving the advancements  made in countering harmful tax competition . The FHTP will now apply a 
methodology for regime reviews that introduces an upfront economic impact assessment on the expected 
BEPS risks, prior to the legislative review. As a result, preferential regimes that are unlikely to create BEPS 
risks will no longer undergo a legislative review by the FHTP, unless explicitly requested by jurisdictions in 
light of the impact assessment.  
This procedural change streamlines the FHTP's work and enhances its focus on regimes that are 
significant for maintaining the integrity of the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard and ensuring a level playing 
field, without requiring jurisdictions to make legislative changes where such changes are not necessary to 
address BEPS risks. 
In addition, the Inclusive Framework agreed on a reduced frequency of the FHTP’s monitoring 
workstreams. The monitoring exercises for substantial activities in non-IP regimes and no or only nominal 
tax jurisdictions as well as the peer review of the transparency framework will now take place once every 
three years, instead of annually.  
The full revised methodology for the work of the FHTP is set out in the Annex to this document. 
BEPS Action 6 – Prevention of Tax Treaty Abuse  
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard  
The minimum standard on treaty shopping included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 6 (OECD, 2015[5]) 
requires Inclusive Framework jurisdictions to include in their tax treaties an express language (generally in 
the preamble) stating parties’ common intention to eliminate double taxation without enabling non-taxation 
or reduced taxation through tax evasio n or avoidance (including through treaty shopping arrangements) , 
along with specific anti-abuse provisions implementing this common intention. Jurisdictions only need to 
satisfy th ese requirements , if requested to do so by another jurisdiction member of th e Inclusive 
Framework. 
Since its launch in 2018, the BEPS Action 6  peer review process has revealed significant and steady 
progress in Inclusive Framework members’ implementation of the BEPS Action 6 minimum standard. The 
number of bilateral agreements concluded between members of the Inclusive Framework has increased 
from only 13 agreements in 2018 to more than 1,600 today. Based on the latest comprehensive report, 
more than 90% of the agreements concluded between Inclusive Framework members are either compliant 
with the minimum standard or are on track to becoming compliant. This increase is due mostly to the entry 
into effect of the provisions of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (BEPS MLI). To date, the BEPS MLI covers 
105 jurisdictions (including 102 Inclusive Framework members) and around 2,000 bilateral tax treaties in 
total. 
As the implementation has reached a mature stage, the focus of BEPS Action 6 has shifted toward 
providing targeted technical assistance to support jurisdictions, where needed, with the implementation of 
the minimum standard. In parallel, assistance has been offered to encourage jurisdictions using the BEPS 
MLI to complete the necessary steps to bring its provisions into effect.

RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens 
In light of the recent changes to the peer review methodology for Action 6  agreed in 2024, the Inclusive 
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further process improvements are required 
at this stage. 
Therefore, given the advanced state of implementation, BEPS Action 6 now focusses on providing targeted 
technical assistance to all Inclusive Framework members to support the implementation of the minimum 
standard. Following the 2023 comprehensive peer review, the frequency of these reviews is now reduced 
to once every five years, with the next review schedul ed for 2 028, thereby easing  the associated  
administrative burdens. Inclusive Framework members can request bespoke technical assistance at any 
time, in particular in relation to the signature or ratification of the BEPS MLI, as well as for questions on 
interpretation, implementation, or practical challenges encountered. The Inclusive Framework Secretariat 
also proactively engages with jurisdictions to support effective implementation. 
BEPS Action 13 – Country-by-Country Reporting 
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard  
The minimum standard on Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting included in the BEPS Final Report on 
Action 13 (OECD, 2015[6]) requires MNE groups with consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR 750 
million to file an annual  CbC report with the tax administration of the jurisdiction where the MNE group is 
headquartered. This report is automatically exchanged under existing international agreements with those 
jurisdictions where the MNE group has resident entities or permanent establishments, provided they have 
implemented the necessary framework for CbC reporting.  
CbC reporting offers tax administrations unprecedented insights into the global activities of MNE groups 
operating within their jurisdiction providing key information such as profit before tax, income tax paid and 
accrued, and the number of employees. Presented in a standardised format, this information improves 
their understanding of the group’s business and supports the high-level assessment of transfer pricing and 
other BEPS-related risks.  
Since the launch of the peer review process  in 2017, implementation of the  BEPS Action 13 minimum 
standard has reached a mature stage, with most Inclusive Framework members successfully ensuring that 
CbC reports are filed and exchanged in line with the minimum standard.  
Reflecting this maturity , the methodology was revised in 2020 to reduce the burden on jurisdictions with 
stable frameworks by introducing a simplified peer review. In the current peer review (2024 -2025), this 
applies to over half of all members. For the remaining members , the annual review remains valuable for 
receiving feedback, addressing recommendations, and promptly identifying issues like delayed exchanges 
or data quality concerns. 
To date, 120 Inclusive Framework members have introduced a CbC reporting filing obligation  for ultimate 
parent entities of MNE groups resident in their jurisdiction, covering virtually all MNE groups that meet the 
filing threshold. Over 4,100 bilateral relationships have been established to facilitate the exchange of CbC 
reports among almost 100 Inclusive Framework members. In total, 81 members are in a position to receive 
CbC reports on fo reign-headed MNE groups, while others have made substantial progress in achieving 
this position. Significant progress has been achieved in supporting the 75 developing countries in the 
Inclusive Framework to gain access to CbC reports . However, continued e fforts are necessary to close 
remaining gaps and ensure that all developing countries can fully benefit from BEPS Action 13.

Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens 
Given the refinements  to the peer review methodology for Action 13 agreed in 2020 , the Inclusive 
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further procedural changes are required at 
this time, but may be considered once the review of the minimum standard it self is completed, at which 
time the peer review will need to be revised to reflect changes to the standard.  
Therefore, with implementation now at a mature stage, the work of BEPS Action 13 is focused on ensuring 
that all Inclusive Framework members – in particular developing countries – can effectively access and 
use CbC reports effectively. While many developing countries have introduced domestic legislation  
requiring the filing of CbC reports and others have draft legislation in progress , fewer have completed the 
technical steps needed to receive reports under the automatic exchange  of information framework. To 
close this gap, a targeted approach will now be deployed empowering developing country members to set 
their own implementation timelines for acces sing CbC reports  and receive tailored support  from the 
Secretariat.  
 Close e ngagement with developing countries has further highlighted that access to suitable IT tools 
remains a major barrier to receiving and using CbC reports. While larger jurisdictions have developed or 
purchased advanced systems, these are often too costly and complex for developing countries with limited 
reporting volumes. To address this, the Inclusive Framework is exploring options  to make available low- 
or no-cost IT solutions tailored to the needs of developing countries. These tools, combined with access 
to the OECD Common Transmission System, are expected to significantly facilitate access to CbC reports 
by all interested developing countries.  
BEPS Action 14 – Mutual Agreement Procedures  
Progress in implementation of the minimum standard  
The minimum standard included in the BEPS Final Report on Action 14 (OECD, 2015[7]) aims to improve 
tax treaty dispute resolution through three core principles: timely and good -faith implementation of Mutual 
Agreement Procedures (MAP) obligations, effective administrative processes, and g uaranteed access to 
MAP for eligible taxpayers. These principles have been operationalised through 21 measurable elements 
assessed via a peer review process. 
As implementation has matured, the peer reviews for the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard have yielded 
tangible results in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness of MAP across Inclusive 
Framework’s jurisdictions. Over 500 treaties have been modified by the BEPS MLI to incorporate effective 
MAP provisions, while other jurisdictions h ave taken or plan  to take bilateral actions to modify their tax 
treaties. Access to MAP is available in most eligible cases, with several issues being effectively addressed 
through recommendations in the peer review process. 
Progress in the implementation of BEPS Action 14 is further reflected in the widespread publication of MAP 
guidance and profiles  by most peer -reviewed jurisdictions , as well as by notable  improvements in the 
organisation of competent authority functions . These advancements h ave enabled many jurisdictions to 
get much closer to the target of resolving MAP cases within an average timeframe of 24 months.  
To date, 82 jurisdictions in the Inclusive Framework have completed the peer review processes. A revised 
peer review approach now includes  a full peer review process for experienced MAP jurisdictions and a 
simplified peer review process for jurisdictions with limited or no MAP experience.  
The full peer review process is currently assessing 58 of jurisdictions with meaningful MAP experience in 
meeting the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard. Additionally, 68 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions with 
limited or no MAP experience have undergone or are currently undergoing a simplified peer review

process, with reports for 20 jurisdictions already publ ished, and another 17 scheduled for review in the 
coming months. Jurisdictions also report statistics related to their tax certainty obligations under BEPS 
Action 14. The ongoing collection of information ensures transparency, with information about each 
jurisdiction’s MAP function available through published MAP guidance or MAP profiles.  
Way forward to maintain progress, while reducing burdens 
Given the recent updates to the peer review methodology for Action 1 4 agreed in 202 3, the Inclusive 
Framework agreed at its Plenary meeting in April 2025 that no further changes are required at this time. 
Therefore, as the implementation of  BEPS Action 14 reaches a mature phase, attention has shifted to 
ensuring that all members – particularly developing countries – can fully benefit from effective MAP 
processes. Developing countries that were initially excluded from peer reviews as they were in the process 
of setting up a MAP function are now gaining MAP e xperience and are engaging in peer review process 
for managing MAP caseloads efficiently and effectively, in line with the objectives of BEPS Action 14. 
This has also been reflected in the simplified peer review process for jurisdictions without meaningful MAP 
experience, aimed at helping them build a strong foundation for future cases, alongside a full review for 
jurisdictions with more established MAP practices. Early results show strong commitment, particularly from 
lower-capacity jurisdictions, which have welcomed the simplified process as a valuable tool for developing 
their MAP frameworks and allocating necessary resources.  
These efforts are further reinforced by targeted capacity -building initiatives, such as MAP workshops for 
developing country officials, offering practical training on dispute resolution under  BEPS Action 14.

Annex A. Revised methodology for the work of 
the FHTP 
Revised methodology for the review of preferential regimes 
Introduction 
The FHTP’s work of reviewing preferential regimes started in 1998, which is almost 30 years ago. During 
these years, the FHTP has reviewed preferential regimes to avoid them creating harmful tax competition. 
The FHTP’s reviews focus on regimes that provide benefits to business income from geographically mobile 
activities (i.e. regimes within the FHTP’s scope). These regimes can pose BEPS -risks if they contain 
potentially harmful features.  
Since the start of the BEPS project, and with the formation of the I nclusive Framework, the FHTP has 
expanded its scope of reviews beyond those of OECD Member States to encompass the full membership 
of the Inclusive Framework. 1 Since the start of the BEPS project the FHTP has reviewed a total of 332 
regimes. The results of these regime reviews are published in the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]), 
the 2017 Progress Repor t (OECD, 2017[8]), the 2018 Progress Report  (OECD, 2019[9]) and on a regular 
basis on the OECD’s website as new results become available. 
In recent years, there have been an increasing number of instances where preferential regimes that pose 
a limited BEPS risk are technically in the scope of the FHTP work (e.g. free trade zone regimes that permit 
a wide range of activities and provide a preferential tax rate, including for services or Intellectual Property 
(IP)). This is mainly because these regimes primarily or almost e xclusively target non -geographically 
mobile activities such as manufacturing, warehousing, primary resource exploitation and agriculture, while 
technically still allowing service income and income from IP to benefit from the regime. In addition, the 
FHTP has also reviewed regimes that have a (very) limited uptake and therefore pose little BEPS -risks. 
Under the previous methodology, the first step of an FHTP review was to undertake a legislative review of 
a preferential regime before conducting an impact ass essment in respect of the BEPS -risk. This 
methodology has in certain cases, especially in recent years, led to (often new) Inclusive Framework 
members being required to adjust their legislation to comply with the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard, 
prior to finding evidence of BEPS risks.  
For these reasons, the Inclusive Framework has revised the methodology for the review of regimes so that 
they will commence with an initial BEPS impact assessment, before conducting the legislative review. The 
revised methodology ensures that those preferential regimes that are unlikely to lead to BEPS -risks are 
not upfront subjected to a legislative review by the FHTP, therewith streamlining the FHTP’s work and 
strengthening the focus on preferential regimes that are material  for maintaining the integrity of the BEPS 
 
1 In addition, some preferential regimes with harmful features may be offered by jurisdictions that are not members of 
the Inclusive Framework. In order to ensure a level playing field, such jurisdictions are able to be identified by the 
members of the Inclusive Framework as being relevant to the work and are reviewed according to the same criteria 
as apply for all other jurisdictions. These are “jurisdictions of relevance”.

Action 5 minimum standard and the level playing field.  The revised methodology is effective from its 
adoption at the Inclusive Framework’s April 2025 Plenary meeting.  
This chapter sets out the revised methodology, which can be summarised as follows:  
• Step 1. Identification of regimes that may be within the FHTP’s scope. This identification will initially 
be made by the jurisdiction itself, by another Inclusive Framework member or by the FHTP 
Secretariat (hereafter Secretariat); 
• Step 2.  Initial assessment by the Secretariat to determine whether the regime falls within the 
FHTP’s scope; 
• Step 3.  Compilation of regimes (potentially) to be reviewed by the FHTP, based on identified 
regimes that are determined to be within the scope of the FHTP. This list will be divided into:  
1. a list of regimes for which the jurisdiction providing the preferential regime opts for an 
immediate legislative review by the FHTP under Step 5 (thereby bypassing Step 4);  
2. a list of regimes for which a BEPS impact assessment under Step 4 is to be considered by the 
FHTP; and 
3. a list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP including those for which no 
BEPS impact assessment or legislative review is undertaken;  
• Step 4. BEPS impact assessment, with the following possible conclusions: 
o the regime could have a significant BEPS impact and the FHTP should undertake a legislative 
review of the regime; or 
o the regime currently does not have a significant BEPS impact  and the FHTP should not 
undertake a legislative review of the regime at this moment; or 
o the BEPS impact assessment of the regime is currently inconclusive and the FHTP does not 
undertake a legislative review of the regime at this moment, but it will be sub ject to ongoing 
monitoring for three years;  
• Step 5. Legislative review.  
The below image sets out the steps of the revised methodology in a graphical manner.

Revised methodology for regime reviews 
This section sets out in further detail the revised meth odology for identifying, assessing, and reviewing 
preferential regimes.  
Step 1. Identification 
The first step is the identification or self-identification of the preferential regime. This is an essential step in 
the FHTP’s review process, because without it, the FHTP is not aware of all the regimes that may require 
review. The FHTP should consider reviewing a regime of an Inclusive Framework member, or a non -
Inclusive Framework member  if considered a jurisdiction of relevance, only if it is identified by another 
Inclusive Framework member, by the jurisdiction offering the preferential regime itself, or by the 
Secretariat.  
When an Inclusive Framework member seeks to identify a preferen tial regime of another Inclusive 
Framework member or a regime of a (potential) jurisdiction of relevance, it will notify the Secretariat. This 
can be done at any moment in time and on informal and anonymous basis. It will not be communicated 
with the FHTP whether the regime was identified by the Secretariat or by another Inclusive Framework 
member. 
The Secretariat’s research of preferential regimes is based on an evaluation of any relevant or recent 
developments from public sources. However, the FHTP should not rely solely on the Secretariat’s findings 
or the limitations of its research, because the collection and analysis of publicly available data may be 
affected by factors such as scope, accessibility, and reliability of these resources. 
Step 2. Secretariat’s initial assessment 
If a regime has been identified or self-identified, the Secretariat will, working with the concerned jurisdiction, 
conduct an initial assessment to determine whether the regime potentially falls within the FHTP scope (i.e. 
is the regime preferential and does it provide tax benefits to business income from geographically mobile 
activities, including the provision of intangibles).  
In line with the FHTP’s standing practice under its previous methodology, if a regime is found to be out of 
scope under Step 2, it will not be reviewed by the FHTP, nor will any monitoring be carried out. This 
outcome will be communicated to the jurisdiction(s) that have identified or self -identified the regime and 
the regime will be included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). If a 
regime is found to be within the FHTP’s scope , it will be included in the list of regimes to be potentially 
submitted to a BEPS impact assessment (list 2) under Step 3. 
If a jurisdiction requests the FHTP to register a regime that is offered in that jurisdiction as an out-of-scope 
regime, the regime will be reviewed promptly under Step 5 (i.e. without a BEPS impact assessment) . In 
those instances, the out-of-scope conclusion, if adopted by the FHTP, would be published. 
Step 3. Compilation of regimes potentially to be reviewed 
As this methodology aims to focus the review primarily on cases with a significant BEPS-risk, it is important 
to ensure that the FHTP maintains visibility of all prefe rential regimes that are in scope. A compilation of 
regimes within the scope of the FHTP’s review will therefore be circulated before each FHTP meeting in 
order for the FHTP to determine which regimes should be reviewed, in light of their potential to crea te 
significant BEPS-risks. The compilation consists of three parts:  
1. A list of regimes for which the jurisdiction opted for a legislative review of the regime. This 
section is shared with the FHTP for information and the regimes contained in this list will  
immediately proceed to the legislative review under Step 5;

# Page 17
16    
 
RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
2. A list of regimes that are within the scope of the FHTP, including a preliminary indication from 
the Secretariat on whether and why the regime should or should not undergo a BEPS impact 
assessment under Step 4. This section is shared with the FHTP for approval; and 
3. A list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP including those for which no 
BEPS impact assessment or legislative review is undertaken. This section is shared with the  
FHTP for information. 
Each list will include a brief description of the regime, along with details about the features and scale of 
the jurisdiction offering the regime (e.g. the size of the economy and previous existence of preferential 
regimes), as well as the level of tax preference (e.g. exemption or lower tax rate). This information allows 
the FHTP to have a high -level appreciation of the regime, which assists the FHTP in its decision of 
undertaking a BEPS impact assessment or to proceed with the revie w of a regime on the list of regimes 
for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). The content of the three lists is further outlined 
below. 
List 1: regimes proceeding to legislative review at the request of the jurisdiction  
This list includes r egimes that a jurisdiction explicitly requested to undergo a legislative review. The 
outcome of the legislative review may determine that the regime is out of scope.  
Regimes on this list will not undergo an impact assessment. Instead, they will proceed di rectly to a 
legislative review under Step 5, either at the next or a subsequent FHTP meeting. As such, this list is 
shared with the FHTP for information purposes only. 
Note that under this revised methodology, the FHTP will no longer be able to conclude th at a regime is 
“potentially harmful but not actually harmful” (see further explanation under Step 4 below). This is because 
the consideration as to whether a potentially harmful regime is actually harmful is now replaced by the prior 
BEPS impact assessment  at Step 4. By opting not to submit the regime to a BEPS impact assessment 
under Step 4 and agreeing to proceed directly to legislative review, the jurisdiction agrees that such a 
legislative review is sufficient for determining whether a regime is harmful  or not and there is no need to 
undertake a separate BEPS impact assessment to determine whether the regime is actually harmful or 
not.  
List 2: regimes to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact assessment  
The regimes on this second list are regimes th at are within the scope of the FHTP’s review (i.e. they are 
preferential to business income from geographically mobile activities), and for which the FHTP must 
consider whether it is necessary to undertake a BEPS impact assessment.  
As mentioned in paragraph 0, each regime will include a brief description of the regime and details on the 
features and size of the jurisdiction offering the regime, as well as the level of tax preference. This supports 
the FHTP in determining whether a listed regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment under Step 
4. To prepare the FHTP for its decision, the Secretariat will also share its preliminary proposal for the 
decision by the FHTP, taking into account whether the regime is prima facie unlikely to produce a significant 
BEPS impact, e.g. because the rate of the regime is relatively high or because the jurisdiction offering the 
regime is a low-income economy.  
Regimes included on this list will proceed to a BEPS impact assessment, unless the FHTP decides on a 
consensus basis that no BEPS impact assessment will take place. In such case, the regime will be included 
in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).

List 3: regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP 
For the purpose of visibility for the FHTP, certain regimes will be recorded in this separate list of the 
compilation, which is shared for information with the FHTP in advance of subsequent meetings.  
This list will include the following types of regimes:  
• Regimes identified under Step 1 that are out of the FHTP’s scope as a result of Step 2;  
• Regimes within the FHTP’s scope for which no BEPS impact assessment is undertaken (as a result 
of Step 3); 
• Regimes that were concluded as “not harmful” following a BEPS impact assessment under Step 
4; 
• Regimes that are subject to ongoing monitoring following a BEPS impact assessment under Step 
4; 
• Regimes that were previously con cluded as “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”, 
“disadvantaged areas” and “non-operational”; 
• Grandfathered non-IP regimes for which the transitional period has not yet ended; 
• IP regimes providing benefits to the third category of IP assets or the rebuttable presumption; and 
• Any other types of regimes the FHTP has decided to include in this list. 
Both Inclusive Framework members and the Secretariat may propose that a regime on this list be 
reconsidered for a BEPS impact assessment in accordance with Steps 3 and 4 at any subsequent moment 
in time. The brief description of the regime and details on the features and size of the jurisdiction offering 
the regime as mentioned in paragraph 0 will assist the FHTP in undertaking this reconsideration, as well 
as any new potential information that became available. The process in this regard is the same as for the 
initial identification of regimes, as set out under Step 1 and can be undertaken at any moment. 
In a similar regard, both Inclusive Framework members and the Secretariat may also propose that a regime 
on this list will be removed, e.g. because no BEPS risks have substantiated over a prolonged period of 
time. Such decision would be taken on a consensus basis by the FHTP.  
Step 4. BEPS impact assessment 
Once a regime has been identified and determined to be within the scope of the FHTP’s work, and the 
FHTP has decided to pursue a BEPS impact assessment, the Secreta riat will conduct an impact 
assessment of the regime in terms of its BEPS -risks, working with the concerned jurisdiction. Based on 
the outcome of the impact assessment, the FHTP will decide if the regime should be legislatively reviewed 
or not (under Step 5).  
The BEPS impact assessment is an assessment of the expected economic effects of the regime in terms 
of producing BEPS -risks for other jurisdictions. As such, the Secretariat will, inter alia, take into account 
the following factors for determining the impact of the regime in terms of BEPS-risks: 
• the primary objectives of the regime: e.g. if the regime is focussed on manufacturing activities, and 
not on geographically mobile activities, or if the regime only targets disadvantaged areas, the BEPS 
impact of the regime could be low;  
• the jurisdiction offering the regime: e.g. if the jurisdiction has a low GDP or is classified as a low -
income economy by the World Bank, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;  
• the number of taxpayers benefiting from the r egime (if available): e.g. if only a small number of 
taxpayers is benefitting from the regime, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;  
• the total income subject to preferential tax treatment (if available): e.g. if only a small amount of 
income is benefitting from the regime, the BEPS impact of the regime could be low;  
• when the regime is a replacement regime of the previous regime, data from the previous regime  
and the FHTP’s previous experience; and

# Page 19
18    
 
RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
• any other factor(s) or source of information deemed t o be relevant for the BEPS impact 
assessment, to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  
Based on the BEPS impact assessment, the Secretariat will propose one of the following three decisions 
to the FHTP: 
• Proceed with legislative review. 
When the assessment indicates that the regime could have a significant BEPS impact, the FHTP 
should undertake a legislative review of the regime, as described under Step 5. T he decision to 
that effect is taken by the FHTP on a consensus minus-one basis. 
• No legislative review. 
When the assessment indicates that the regime is not expected to have a significant BEPS impact, 
the FHTP would conclude its review by finding the regime “not harmful”. The decision to that effect 
is taken by the FHTP on a consensus basis. The regime will be included in the FHTP’s public lists 
of regimes as well as the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).   
• No legislative review, but ongoing monitoring. 
When the assessment is either inconclusive or indicates that the regime could potentially, but does 
not currently have a significant BEPS impact, the FHTP would keep the regime “under review” and 
would annually monitor the regime for three years. The decision to that effect is taken by the FHTP 
on a consensus minus-one basis. The regime will be included in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes 
as well as the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).  
If the FHTP cannot agree on the outcomes of the BEPS impact assessment, the dec ision will be deferred 
to the next FHTP meeting. In the meantime, the Secretariat will conduct further research into the regime 
and will work towards obtaining consensus (minus -one) amongst delegates on the decision to be taken. 
The regime will be kept “under review” and will be included in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes.  
Step 5. Legislative review 
Either upon request of the jurisdiction offering the regime, or as a result of the BEPS impact assessment 
under Step 4, the FHTP will undertake a legislative review of the regime. This is a review of the legislation 
of the regime against the FHTP’s criteria.  
The FHTP conducts its reviews of preferential regimes against a number of factors, originally set out in the 
1998 Report (OECD, 1998[3]), which laid the foundation for the OECD’s work on harmful tax practices, 
currently consist of five key factors and five other factors.  
Five key factors 
The regime imposes no or low effective tax rates on income from geographically 
mobile financial and other service activities. 
The regime is ring-fenced from the domestic economy. 
The regime lacks transparency. 
There is no effective exchange of information with respect to the regime. 
The regime fails to require substantial activities.2 
Five other factors 
An artificial definition of the tax base. 
Failure to adhere to international transfer pricing principles. 
Foreign source income exempt from residence country taxation. 
Negotiable tax rate or tax base. 
Existence of secrecy provisions. 
 
2 This includes the 2015 BEPS Action 5 Final Report (OECD, 2015[2]), the 2017 Progress Report (OECD, 2017[8]), and 
any guidance on substantial activities agreed by the FHTP and Inclusive Framework thereafter.

Each key factor is briefly described below.  
• The regime imposes no or low effective tax rates on income from geographically mobile financial 
and other service activities. 
A low or zero effective tax rate on the relevant income  is a necessary starting point for an 
examination of whether a preferential tax regime is harmful. When a preferential regime benefits 
income from geographically mobile activities and meets this factor, it is in scope for the FHTP. 
However, the tax rate factor alone does not imply that a preferential regime is harmful; rather it is 
a gateway criterion that if met means that the FHTP will continue the review process to determine 
if one or more of the other key factors are implicated.  
• The regime is ring-fenced from the domestic economy. 
Some preferential tax regimes are partly or fully insulated from the domestic economy of the 
jurisdiction providing the regime. The fact that a jurisdiction has designed the regime in a way that 
protects its own economy from t he regime by ring -fencing provides a strong indication that a 
regime has the potential to create harmful spill-over effects. Ring-fencing focusses on the legal or 
administrative barriers to participation in the domestic economy, rather than the case where only 
a small number of domestic  taxpayers take advantage of the regime . Ring-fencing may take a 
number of forms, including: 
o A regime may explicitly or implicitly exclude resident taxpayers from taking advantage of its 
benefits.  
o Enterprises which benefit from the regime may be explicitly or implicitly prohibited from 
operating in the domestic market. 
• The regime lacks transparency. 
A lack of transparency may arise from the way in which a regime is designed and administered. 
For example, where the de tails of the regime or its application are not apparent, or there is 
inadequate regulatory supervision or financial disclosure.  
• There is no effective exchange of information with respect to the regime. 
When the jurisdiction lacks an effective exchange of information with respect to the regime, this 
can inhibit the ability of other tax authorities to enforce effectively its rules. 
• The regime encourages operations or arrangements that are purely tax -driven and involve no 
substantial activities. 
This factor has been elaborated in the work of the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015), requiring 
that in order to benefit from a preferential regime, the taxpayer must have engaged in the activities 
giving rise to the income.  
In the case of regimes that give benefits to income from intellectual property (“IP”), this requirement 
means being compliant with the “nexus approach” as detailed in the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 
2015[2]). The nexus approach requires a link betwe en the income benefiting from the IP regime 
and the extent to which the taxpayer has undertaken the underlying research and development 
that generated the intellectual property. The FHTP uses a substantive approach, reviewing IP 
regimes that are targeted at IP income (such as patent boxes) as well as regimes that provide for 
benefits to a wider range of geographically mobile activities but include income from IP (such as 
certain free zones or international business companies).  
The BEPS Action 5 Report  (OECD, 2015 [2]) also contains more general guidance for the 
application of the substantial activities criterion to non-IP regimes, and further detail on the FHTP’s 
approach is set out in Annex D of the 2017 Progress Report  (OECD, 2017[8]). This ensures that 
the core income generating activities are undertaken, including with an adequate number of full -
time, qualified employees and an adequate amount of operating expenditure, supported b y a 
transparent mechanism to ensure compliance.

If the regime meets the gateway criterion of imposing no or low effective tax rates on income from 
geographically mobile financial and other service activities  and is not compliant with one or more of the 
other key factors, it would be found to be “harmful”. Under the previous methodology, the FHTP could also 
conclude regimes as “potentially harmful” and “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”. However, this 
assessment is now undertaken before the FHTP’s legislative review and is therefore no longer a potential 
outcome after such review. Where a regime is found to be “harmful”, the jurisdiction is expected to amend 
or abolish the regime in accordance with the FHTP timelines. This includes ensuring that such regimes are 
quickly closed-off to new applicants and new expansions of business activities, and that any grandfathering 
is provided for a limited transition period only. These timelines are set out below under the procedural 
aspects. 
Procedural aspects 
Conclusions 
The review by the FHTP can result in one of the following conclusions:  
Result Meaning Decision taken in  
Harmful  The regime has harmful features. The jurisdiction is expected to take 
measures in order to remove the harmful features of the regime. 
Step 5 
Not harmful  The regime is in scope but does not have harmful features or a significant 
BEPS impact. 
Step 4 or 5 
Amended (not harmful) The regime has had its harmful features removed and is therefore not 
harmful. 
Step 5 
Out of scope The regime does not grant tax benefits to geographically mobile activities. Step 5 
Amended (out of scope) The regime has been amended so that it no longer grants tax benefits to 
geographically mobile activities and is therefore out of scope for  the 
FHTP. 
Step 5 
In the process of being 
amended / in the process of 
being eliminated 
The jurisdiction has communicated to the FHTP the commitment of its 
government to abolish or amend the regime in light of the discussions by 
the FHTP about the features  of the regime that are of concern . This 
commitment involves a commitment to making the amendments within 
the timelines indicated below. 
Step 5 
Abolished A definite date for complete abolition of the regime has been announced, 
and the regime is transparent and has effective exchange of information. 
No new entrants are permitted into the regime. Any grandfathering for 
existing beneficiaries is consistent with the applicable framework and 
timelines. 
Step 5 
Under review The FHTP is continuing to co nsider the features of the regime and 
whether the criteria are implicated. 
Step 4 or 5

Timelines  
As noted in the above table, one of the conclusions that the FHTP can reach is “in the process of being 
amended/eliminated”. This conclusion is reached when the FHTP decided that the regime has potentially 
harmful features that need to be removed, but when the jurisdiction made a commitment to abolish or 
amend the regime. In those instances, the timelines for closing-off and grandfathering are:  
Timelines for closing-off and grandfathering of regimes 
Event Explanation Timeline 
Cut-off date for new entrants (both new 
taxpayers and new assets and/or 
activities of existing taxpayers) to be 
eligible for grandfathering 
When a jurisdiction provides 
grandfathering, new entrants (both new 
taxpayers and new assets and/or 
activities of existing taxpayers) coming 
into the regime after the cut -off date 
should not benefit from grandfathering 
after the close-off date.3 
Publication date of the FHTP’s decision 
Close-off date (the date the regime is 
amended or abolished) 
Closing-off the regime means that no 
new entrants are allowed to use the 
regime. New entrants include both new 
taxpayers, but also new assets (e.g. IP 
assets) and/or new activities of existing 
taxpayers. 
As soon as possible, and no later than 
12 months after the publication date of 
the FHTP’s decision (or where 
necessary because of the legislative 
process, by 31 December of the year 
following the cut-off date) 
Grandfathering period  This is the maximum transition period 
granted to entrants benefiting from the 
regime as at the cut -off date. 
Jurisdictions are generally permitted, 
but not required, to provide 
grandfathering (see below).  
31 December in the yea r which is three 
years after the publication date of the 
FHTP’s decision. For example, if a 
regime is reported as “in the process of 
being amended / eliminated ” in July 
2025, the end of grandfathering would 
be no later than 31 December 2028. 
Only ring-fenced regimes and regimes lacking substantial activities requirements can be grandfathered. 
Regimes lacking transparency and exchange of information cannot be grandfathered with respect to the 
harmful aspect of that regime.  
Regimes under review before revised methodology  
All regimes for which no final conclusion was reached before the revised methodology is effective, will be 
removed from the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and reviewed in accordance with all steps of the revised 
methodology.  
 
3 When a regime is kept “under review” by the FHTP, then no decision has yet been made. Publication includes public 
release of the regime conclusions on the OECD website after the regime results have been approved and declassified 
by the Inclusive Framework, as well as in FHTP Progress Reports, whichever is earlier.

Potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes 
The revised methodology covers the BEPS impact assessment that is currently conducted as part of the 
review of whether a regime is “potentially harmful but not actually harmful”. Therefore, this review, which 
is condu cted when a regime has potentially harmful features based on the legislative review , is now 
removed and replaced by the BEPS impact assessment under Step 4 of the revised methodology.  
All regimes for which a “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” conclusion was reached, will remain 
on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and will be added to the list of regimes for possible further 
consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP can reconsider the regime at any given moment. 
Disadvantaged areas regimes 
Certain jurisdictions have introduced tax incentive regimes designed to encourage development in 
disadvantaged areas and which, whilst they do not specifically provide a preferential treatment for income 
from IP, they may include (or do not specifically exclude) such income. The BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 
2015[2]) considered that such regimes do not pose significant BEPS -risks, provided the regime  is only 
applicable to a relatively small and economically disadvantaged area, the regime is mainly  designed to 
create new jobs and attract tangible investments , significant substance is demonstrated in terms of the 
generation of new employment, assets and investments and  the regime is subject to monitoring by the 
FHTP. 
As for “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” regimes, the impact assessment under Step 4 of the 
revised methodology now also considers whether a regime provides benefits to disadvantaged areas. The 
FHTP will therefore no longer conclude a regime as a disadvantaged areas regime during the legislative 
review. The current disadvantaged areas regimes will remain on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and 
will be added to the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP 
can reconsider the regime at any given moment.  
Non-operational regimes 
A preferential regime is not operational if the jurisdiction did not operationalise the regime and no taxpayer 
is able to benefit from it. If such a regime becomes operational in the future, the jurisdiction has committed 
to inform the FHTP and the regime will be reviewed. 
All regimes that were concluded as non-operational before the revised methodology is effective, will remain 
on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and will be added to the  list of regimes for possible further 
consideration by the FHTP (list 3) so that the FHTP can reconsider the regime at any given moment.  
Examples  
The following list of non -exhaustive example s illustrates the practical application of the revised 
methodology:  
• Example 1: Jurisdiction A offers a preferential regime that is identified by Jurisdiction B (step 1). 
The Secretariat undertakes an initial assessment (step 2) and concludes that no incom e from 
geographically mobile activities can benefit from the regime. The Secretariat informs both 
Jurisdiction A and Jurisdiction B and no further steps are taken. The regime is included in the list 
of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
• Example 2: Jurisdiction C introduces a new IP regime. It identifies it to the Secretariat (step 1), and 
the Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). Jurisdiction C 
wishes to have an FHTP’s conclusion publi shed, because its stakeholders have requested this. 
Jurisdiction C opts for the legislative review by the FHTP (step 3). The FHTP undertakes the 
legislative review (step 5) and publishes the conclusion on the regime.

• Example 3: Jurisdiction D joins the Inclusive Framework. The Secretariat identifies that Jurisdiction 
D has five preferential regimes (step 1) of which two are in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). 
The Secretariat presents the two regimes to the FHTP  under step 3. The FHTP concludes by 
consensus that the regimes should not undergo a BEPS impact assessment and therefore, the 
Secretariat records these regimes in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the 
FHTP (list 3).  
• Example 4: The facts are the same as in example 3, exce pt that the FHTP decides that one in -
scope regime from Jurisdiction D is to be reviewed (step 3). The Secretariat performs a BEPS 
impact assessment (step 4) and concludes that the regime is only used by two taxpayers in the 
last five years for a total amou nt of income of EUR 100k. The FHTP concludes that there is no 
expected significant BEPS impact and that the regime is “not harmful”. The regime is included in 
the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
• Example 5: Jurisdiction E introduces a logistic services regime and identifies this to the Secretariat 
(step 1). The Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). The 
regime is included in the list of regimes to be potentially submitted to a  BEPS impact assessment 
(list 2) and the FHTP decides that the regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step 
3). The Secretariat undertakes the BEPS impact assessment (step 4), and concludes that, since 
this is a new regime, no definite conclusion c an be reached. The FHTP decides that there will be 
no legislative review at this stage, but that the regime will be monitored for three years. The regime 
is included as “under review” in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes as well as in the list of regimes 
for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3).  
• Example 6: Jurisdiction F provides for an economic zone regime that the FHTP previously 
determined to be “in the process of being amended”. With the adoption of the revised methodology, 
the regime becomes subject to that methodology. Jurisdiction G identifies the regime (step 1) and 
the Secretariat concludes that the regime is in scope (step 2). The Secretariat includes the regime 
in the list of regimes to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact as sessment (list 2), and the 
FHTP decides that the regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step 3). The 
Secretariat undertakes the BEPS impact assessment (step 4) and proposes that there is no 
expected significant BEPS impact. On that basis, the FHTP adopts as a conclusion that the regime 
is “not harmful”. The regime is included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by 
the FHTP (list 3). 
• Example 7: The Secretariat identifies that Jurisdiction H has an insurance regime (step 1) which is 
in scope of the FHTP’s review (step 2). The Secretariat includes the regime in the list of regimes 
to be potentially submitted to a BEPS impact assessment (list 2), and the FHTP decides that the 
regime should undergo a BEPS impact assessment (step 3). The Secretariat undertakes the BEPS 
impact assessment (step 4) and proposes a legislative review because it could have a significant 
BEPS impact. On that basis, the FHTP decides on a consensus minus -one basis to undertake a 
legislative review under step 5. During the legislative review, the FHTP concludes that the regime 
meets the gateway criterion of a no or low effective tax rate. In addition, the FHTP concludes that 
the regime lacks substantial activities requirements. Finally, the FHTP also concludes t hat the 
regime is ring -fenced, because the benefits are provided only to foreign -sourced income. The 
FHTP decides that the regime can be concluded as “harmful”. Jurisdiction H makes a commitment 
to amend the regime, and therefore, the FHTP concludes in its  public lists of regimes that the 
regime is “in the process of being amended”. In the absence of such a commitment, the FHTP 
would have concluded the regime in the FHTP’s public lists of regimes as “harmful”.

Reducing the scope and frequency of monitoring and peer review exercises  
Introduction 
The FHTP undertakes annual monitoring and peer review exercises. More specifically, it monitors certain 
aspects of regimes and the substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions and it 
reviews jurisdictions’ implementation of the transparency framework that was set out in BEPS Action 5 
Report (OECD, 2015[2]). 
The FHTP now has several years of experience with the annual monitoring and peer review proce sses. 
The annual monitoring for regimes started in 2018, and the annual monitoring for no or only nominal tax 
jurisdictions in 2020. The peer review of the transparency framework commenced in 2017.  
Under the revised methodology set out in this section, th at certain monitoring processes will be 
discontinued and that the frequency of other monitoring process and the peer review of the transparency 
framework, will be reduced. These changes are aimed at decreasing the burden on both assessed 
jurisdictions and the FHTP, while maintaining the progress made and the integrity and value of the 
monitoring exercise. 
In summary, the Inclusive Framework agreed  that the FHTP will reduce the scope of the monitoring of 
preferential regimes, by discontinuing the annual monitoring exercise for: (i) third category of IP assets and 
rebuttable presumption in IP regimes, (ii) potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes, (iii) 
disadvantaged areas regimes, and (iv) grandfathered non -IP regimes. Furthermore, for substantial  
activities in non-IP regimes and substantial activities in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions, the frequency 
of monitoring will be reduced, i.e. once every three years, as opposed to the current annual cycle.  
Reduction of the scope of the monitoring of preferential regimes  
Certain aspects of IP regimes 
The BEPS Action 5 nexus approach sets out the substantial activities requirements for IP regimes. One of 
the features of the nexus approach is to define the categories of IP assets that are eligible for preferential 
tax treatment.  There are three categories of qualifying IP assets: the first category is patents defined 
broadly; the second category is copyrighted software; and the third category is an additional category 
applicable in certain more limited circumstances, where the asset is similar in nature to the former two, but 
has not been subject to the patent approval process.  
The purpose of allowing this third category of IP assets is to recognise that for SMEs, the patent process 
may be prohibitively expensive and very lengthy. In addition, the Inclusive Framework agreed that allowing 
smaller companies to benefit from the IP regime would not appear to pose a significant BEPS -risk. The 
BEPS Action 5 Report  (OECD, 2015[2]) allowed the third category of IP assets, provided that the FHTP 
would annually monitor this category and jurisdictions would spontaneously exchange information on 
taxpayers benefitting from this category (using the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework). 
Furthermore, the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]) allows jurisdictions to treat the nexus ratio as a 
rebuttable presumption. In this scenario, a jurisdiction determines the income receiving tax benefits based 
on the nexus ratio, but permits taxpayers to prove that more income should be permitted to benefit from 
the IP regime in exceptional circumstances where taxpayers that have undertaken substantial qualifying 
R&D activity in developing a qualifying IP asset or product can establish that the application of the nexus 
fraction leads to an outcome where the level of income eligible for a preferential IP regime is not 
commensurate with the level of their R&D activity. The application of this rebuttable presumption is subject 
to specific requirements, in particular that the FHTP would annually monitor this category and that

   25 
 
RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
jurisdictions would spontaneously exchange information on taxpayers benefitting from this category (using 
the BEPS Action 5 transparency framework). 
In light of the annual monitoring results from the past years, and available data more generally, there 
appear to be only a limited number of taxpayers benefitting from the third category of IP assets and  
rebuttable presumption. In addition, BEPS-risks related to these categories appear limited and any future 
regime offering such features could be subject to monitoring as part of the BEPS impact assessment under 
the revised methodology.  
Therefore, this category is monitored for the last time in 2025. The exchange of information requirements 
will be retained. The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s public lists of regimes and, for transparency 
purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
Potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes  
The conclusion of “potentially harmful but not actually harmful” was taken by the FHTP if the  regime is in 
scope, meets the low or no effective tax rate criterio n and implicates one or more of the criteria, but an 
assessment of the economic effects shows that the regime is not having a harmful impact in practice. The 
purpose of monitoring such regimes was that, where changes in the data were identified, the FHTP could 
reconsider the conclusion.  
The revised methodology for reviewing regimes will no longer include the conclusion of “potentially harmful 
but not actually harmful”, because of its replacement by the BEPS impact assessment.  
Therefore, this category is m onitored for the last time in 2025 . The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s 
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible 
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
Disadvantaged areas regimes  
The purpose of the ongoing monitoring of disadvantaged areas regimes  is that if the FHTP finds an 
indication of adverse economic effects from a regime, the FHTP would decide on a case -by-case basis 
what additional data would be necessary to inform a decision as to whether the regime should be treated 
as an IP regime and assessed against the nexus approach.  
The Inclusive Framework already previously decided that, in general, these disadvantaged areas do not 
pose a significant BEPS-risk. Further, the annual monitoring results from the past years suggest that it is 
not expected that there will be a significant increase in the disadvantaged areas regimes that would justify 
reopening conclusions in this respect. In addition, under th e revised methodology, the FHTP no longer 
concludes any disadvantaged areas regimes.  
Therefore, this category is monitored  for the last time in 2025.  The regimes will remain on the FHTP’s 
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be inc luded in the list of regimes for possible 
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
Grandfathered non-IP regimes 
Of all regimes reviewed by the FHTP since the start of the BEPS project, almost 200 have been abolished 
or amended, with a large part foresee ing grandfathering in accordance with the FHTP’s timelines. The 
FHTP’s timelines include a cut -off date (i.e. the date when the FHTP’s decision on regime is published) 
and close-off date (i.e. the date that the regime is abolished or amended). New entrants to the regime after 
the cut-off date and before the close -off date cannot benefit from grandfathering. Part of the legislative 
review of the FHTP is whether these dates are included in the legislation for the regime.

Based on the annual monitoring results from the past years, it appears that for grandfathered regimes, the 
results show that the number of taxpayers and amount of income in the regimes decreases or remains 
stable throughout the grandfathering years. No regime has been reopened by the FHTP bec ause of the 
monitoring results. This indicates that the legislative review done by the FHTP is sufficient and that the 
added value of the monitoring is low.  
Therefore, this category is monitored  for the last time in 2025. The regimes will remain on the FH TP’s 
public lists of regimes and, for transparency purposes, will be included in the list of regimes for possible 
further consideration by the FHTP (list 3). 
Reduced frequency of monitoring and peer review exercises  
Monitoring substantial activities requirements for non-IP regimes  
With the BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]), the substantial activities requirements were elevated to 
one of the key criteria of the FHTP’s review of preferential regimes. In 2017, the FHT P agreed guidance 
on the substantial activities requirements non -IP regimes, which were set out in Annex D of the 2017 
Progress Report (OECD, 2017[8]). The guidance also indicated the need for monitoring to ensure that  the 
substantial activities requirements have been implemented effectively in practice.  
The annual monitoring for substantial activities in non-IP regimes consists of two parts. The first part is “an 
assessment of the jurisdiction’s transparent mechanism t o review taxpayer compliance and to deny 
benefits if these core-income generating activities are not undertaken by the taxpayer or do not occur within 
the jurisdiction”. This mechanism focusses on the enforcement of the legislation in practice (e.g. how 
jurisdictions are ensuring compliance and jurisdictions’ responsiveness to risks of non -compliance). The 
analysis intends to ensure that the regime is consistent with the substantial activities requirements that the 
jurisdiction declared it had in place at the time the FHTP reviewed the regime as “not harmful”. The second 
part of the monitoring is the collection of data regarding the number of taxpayers, the number of employees, 
amount of expenditures, amount of income, and statistics regarding taxpayers that  did not qualify for the 
benefits because they did not meet the substantial activities requirements.  
The FHTP has analysed the annual monitoring results from the past years and concluded that most 
jurisdictions have a transparent review mechanism in place . For any new regimes that are subject to 
monitoring, the FHTP has to review these jurisdictions’ transparent review mechanism, however the 
number of new regimes being introduced is decreasing. This implies that the focus of the FHTP has shifted 
to the sec ond stage of the process, i.e. the review of the statistical data. The  Inclusive Framework 
concluded that this is now an established process. To decrease the burden on the monitored jurisdictions 
and the FHTP, the Inclusive Framework decided a lesser frequ ency in the review of the substantial 
activities requirements in non -IP regimes. Instead of an annual monitoring, monitoring of these regimes 
will take place on a three-yearly basis. The FHTP will still collect data in respect of each of the three years 
for which the monitoring is carried out. 
Outside of the three-year cycle, an intermediate review of a particular regime can occur at any moment in 
time when a reviewed jurisdiction requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented swiftly. 
Generally, if significant issues for a specific regime are identified  between two cycles, an intermediate 
review of that regime can be initiated either at the request of an Inclusive Framework member or by the 
Secretariat.  
Monitoring substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions  
In 2017, the FHTP presented its output of the work on the BEPS Action 5 mandate for considering revisions 
or additions to FHTP framework. As part of this work, the FHTP agreed on the resumption of the application 
of the substantial activities factor to no or only nominal tax jurisdictions. The FHTP identified the no or only

# Page 28
   27 
 
RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
nominal tax jurisdictions in scope of the standard, and performed a legislative review of their legislation for 
the first time in 2019. When there are amendments in the legislation of a jurisdiction, the FHTP reviews 
this too on a rolling basis.  
In line with the FHTP’s standard on substantial activities in non -IP regimes (see above), the FHTP 
introduced in 2019 an annual monitoring procedure for substantial activities requirements in no or only 
nominal tax jurisdictions. As both monitoring processes are based on the same principles, to ensure the 
level playing field, any change to the monitoring of reg imes should align the monitoring of no or only 
nominal tax jurisdictions.  
Like the annual monitoring for substantial activities in non-IP regimes detailed above, the annual monitoring 
exercise for substantial activities requirements in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions incorporates, two 
parts: the transparency review mechanis m and the statistical data.  The results of the monitoring are 
focussed on statistical data, compliance programme and exchange of information. For these three areas, 
it is assessed what the review mechanism is and if the statistical data is complete and doe s not present 
any anomalies. The FHTP can give jurisdiction recommendations in these three areas, which can be hard 
or soft recommendations.  
Based on the annual monitoring results from the past years, it is apparent that  the focus of the monitoring 
exercise is now mainly on the enforcement of the substance requirements and the robustness of the 
compliance program in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions. Accordingly, and as for the substantial activities 
in non-IP regimes, the FHTP’s focus on the monitoring for no or only nominal tax jurisdictions is increasingly 
moving towards the monitoring of statistical data, mainly in respect of the compliance program and the 
enforcement of the standard.  
As the monitoring is now an established process, the Inclusive Fr amework concluded to decrease the 
burden on the monitored jurisdictions and the FHTP by introducing a lower frequency in the review of the 
substantial activities requirements in non or only nominal tax jurisdictions. Instead of an annual monitoring, 
monitoring of these regimes will take place on a three -yearly basis. The FHTP will still collect data in 
respect of each of the three years for which the monitoring is carried out. 
Outside of the three-year cycle, an intermediate review of a particular jurisdiction can occur at any moment 
in time when a reviewed jurisdiction requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented 
swiftly. Generally, if significant issues for a specific no or only nominal tax jurisdiction are identified between 
two cycles, an intermediate review of that jurisdiction can be initiated either at the request of an Inclusive 
Framework member or by the Secretariat.  
Peer review of the transparency framework 
The BEPS Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]) includes a minimum standard on the spontaneous exchange 
of information on tax rulings in respect of certain tax rulings that may create BEPS -risks (“transparency 
framework”). The FHTP commenced a peer review process in 2017 which includes a review of  those 
jurisdictions that can legally issue rulings in scope of the transparency framework. The review focusses on 
the processes that the jurisdiction has in place on the identification of rulings in scope and exchange 
jurisdictions, the exchange of inform ation process and the confidentiality requirements. It also takes into 
account specific exchanges of information with respect to IP regimes that were identified in the BEPS 
Action 5 Report (OECD, 2015[2]).  
Based on the statistics and recommendations resulting from the recent peer reviews of the transparency 
framework, the Inclusive Framework  concluded that the peer review and the implementation of the 
transparency framework is now an established process. Jurisdictions still issue and exchange rulings, but 
most of them are doing this fully in line with the requirements of the transparency framework. As such, it 
appears that it is no longer warranted to conduct a peer review on an annual basis in order to maintain the 
progress made. In addition, the review of the transparency framework is now largely focussed on statistical

# Page 29
28    
 
RECOGNISING PROGRESS AND REDUCING BURDENS IN THE BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS © OECD 2025 
  
data on rulings and exchanges, rather than reviews of the required legal and administrative framework in 
jurisdictions for identifying and exchanging rulings.  
Therefore, the peer review of the transparency framework takes place once every three years, instead of 
the current annual process. In addition, for those jurisdictions that have all elements of the legal and 
administrative framework for identifying and exchanging rulings in place, the three-year peer review will be 
based on a simplified questionnaire, focusing on statistical data. Outside of the three -yearly cycle, an 
intermediate review of a particular jurisdiction can occur at any moment in time when a reviewed jurisdiction 
requests so, in order to ensure that progress can be documented swiftly. 
Summary  
The agreed changes to the FHTP’s scope and frequency of annual monitoring and peer review exercises 
can be summarised as follows:  
• Monitoring of preferential regimes: 
o no more monitoring of (i) third category of IP assets and rebuttable presumption in IP regimes, 
(ii) potentially harmful but not actually harmful regimes, (iii) disadvantaged areas regimes, and 
(iv) grandfathered non-IP regimes; and 
o monitoring of substantial activities requirements in non-IP regimes to occur every three years, 
subject to intermediate reviews in case of improvements or significant issues.  
• Monitoring of substantial activities in no or only nominal tax jurisdictions: 
o to occur every three years, subject to intermediate reviews in case of improvements or 
significant issues. 
• Peer review of the transparency framework on rulings: 
o to occur every three years on the basis of a simplified questionnaire for jurisdictio ns with the 
legal and operational framework in place, subject to intermediate reviews in case of 
improvements. 
Practically, the above conclusions on the frequency of the peer reviews translate into the following 
schedule: 
Workstream Frequency Which years  
Monitoring of no or only nominal tax jurisdictions Once every three years 2026, 2029, etc.  
Peer review transparency framework Once every three years 2027, 2030, etc.  
Monitoring of certain aspects of regimes Once every three years 2028, 2031, etc. 
Review of the revised methodology 
The FHTP will review the revised methodology to assess whether it efficiently operates for addressing 
BEPS risks under BEPS Action 5. This review will take place after the first three -year cycle for all three 
workstreams has been completed.
